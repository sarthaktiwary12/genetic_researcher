### 1. FUNCTION: LUC7 N-terminus domain-containing protein (splicing-related)

*   **KNOWN FACTS**:
    *   LUC7 proteins are highly conserved eukaryotic splicing factors, primarily functioning as components of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP). The U1 snRNP is crucial for the recognition of the 5' splice site during the initial steps of pre-mRNA splicing.
    *   In *Arabidopsis thaliana*, there are three LUC7 homologs: *AtL
