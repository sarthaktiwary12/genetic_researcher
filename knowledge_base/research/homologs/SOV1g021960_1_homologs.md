> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV1g021960.1 - Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like** belongs to the Cation-Chloride Co-transporter (CCC) family, which plays crucial roles in ion homeostasis, osmoregulation, and turgor maintenance in plants.

Here's a detailed analysis of its closest characterized homologs:

---

### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog for SOV1g021960.1 is likely:

*   **Gene Name and Locus ID:** **Cation-Chloride Co-transporter 1 (AtCCC1)**, locus ID **AT1G04040**.
    *   BLAST searches using CCC protein sequences from various plants consistently identify *AtCCC1* as a primary homolog.
*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes:**
    *   **Reduced Growth and Ion Imbalance:** *Atccc1* knockout mutants exhibit significant reductions in plant growth, particularly in root length, and show altered ion content, including lower K+ and higher Cl- accumulation in shoots (Colmenero-Flores et al., 2007, *The Plant Cell*).
    *   **Salt Stress Sensitivity:** Mutants are hypersensitive to high salt concentrations (NaCl), indicating a role in salt tolerance (Colmenero-Flores et al., 2007). This sensitivity is linked to impaired K+ retention and Cl- extrusion.
    *   **Altered Stomatal Function:** *AtCCC1* is expressed in guard cells, and its disruption can affect stomatal opening and closure, impacting water relations and CO2 uptake (Henderson et al., 2015, *Plant Physiology*).
    *   **No direct germination-specific mutant phenotypes have been widely reported for *Atccc1* in the primary literature.** However, its role in ion and water balance is fundamentally important for successful germination, especially under stress conditions.
*   **Key Publications Characterizing this Gene:**
    *   **Colmenero-Flores, J. M., et al. (2007). The Arabidopsis Cation-Chloride Co-transporter AtCCC1 is essential for K+ and Cl- homeostasis and plant growth. *The Plant Cell*, 19(9), 3214-3228.** This study provided the initial comprehensive characterization of *AtCCC1*, detailing its role in ion transport and demonstrating the growth defects and salt sensitivity of *atccc1* mutants.
    *   **Henderson, S. W., et al. (2015). A Cation-Chloride Co-transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana is involved in stomatal movement. *Plant Physiology*, 168(4), 1641-1651.** This work explored the role of *AtCCC1* in guard cell function and stomatal regulation.

### 2. OTHER MODEL SPECIES

CCC homologs are widely conserved across the plant kingdom, reflecting their fundamental roles.

*   **Rice (Oryza sativa):**
    *   **OsCCC1** (e.g., Os04g0615500) is a well-characterized homolog.
    *   **Phenotypes:** *OsCCC1* plays a critical role in K+ and Cl- homeostasis and is strongly implicated in **salt tolerance**. Overexpression of *OsCCC1* in rice has been shown to enhance salt tolerance by improving K+ retention and reducing Na+ accumulation in shoots (Ren et al., 2013, *The Plant Cell*; Chen et al., 2016, *Plant Physiology*).
    *   **Germination/Seedling Vigor:** While direct *OsCCC1* mutant phenotypes specifically for germination are not always highlighted, its role in maintaining ion balance and mitigating salt stress strongly implies an indirect but crucial role in **seedling vigor**, especially under saline conditions. Salt stress is a major inhibitor of rice germination and early seedling growth, and *OsCCC1*'s function in ion transport would be essential for overcoming such stress.
*   **Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum):**
    *   Homologs (e.g., **SlCCC1**) exist and are expected to play similar roles in ion transport and stress response. Less direct functional characterization in terms of specific knockout/overexpression studies compared to *Arabidopsis* or rice, but gene expression studies often show their involvement in responses to salinity or drought.
*   **Other Crops:** CCC genes are found in maize, wheat, barley, etc., and are generally associated with ion homeostasis, osmoregulation, and stress tolerance (e.g., salt, drought). Their contribution to maintaining cellular turgor and ion gradients is vital for overall plant health and productivity, including early developmental stages.

### 3. FUNCTIONAL EVIDENCE

*   **Loss-of-function (knockout/knockdown) phenotypes:**
    *   As described for *AtCCC1* and *OsCCC1*, LOF mutants typically exhibit reduced growth, altered ion content (e.g., lower K+, higher Cl-), and hypersensitivity to abiotic stresses, particularly salinity (Colmenero-Flores et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2013). This highlights their essential role in ion transport and stress adaptation.
*   **Overexpression phenotypes:**
    *   Overexpression of CCC genes, such as *OsCCC1* in rice, can lead to enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses like salinity, often by improving K+ retention and reducing toxic ion accumulation (Chen et al., 2016). This suggests a potential for biotechnological applications to improve crop resilience.
*   **Expression patterns during germination (if known):**
    *   While specific studies focusing on *AtCCC1* expression *during germination* are not prominent, CCC genes are generally expressed in various plant tissues, including roots, shoots, and developing embryos. Given their role in ion and water balance, it is highly probable that they are expressed during imbibition and early germination to facilitate water uptake and establish ion gradients necessary for cell expansion and metabolic activation. Their expression is often induced or modulated under stress conditions relevant to germination (e.g., salinity).
*   **Protein interaction partners:**
    *   Direct protein interaction partners for CCC transporters are less frequently reported compared to regulatory proteins or signaling components. Their function is primarily as integral membrane proteins facilitating ion transport. However, like many transporters, they may interact with scaffolding proteins or regulatory kinases/phosphatases that modulate their activity or trafficking. This area is less explored for CCCs compared to their transport function.

### 4. GERMINATION-SPECIFIC DATA

*   **Regulation during seed imbibition/germination:**
    *   While not extensively studied for *AtCCC1* specifically, the general class of ion transporters and aquaporins are known to be crucial for water uptake and ion redistribution during imbibition and germination. Changes in cellular turgor and ion gradients are fundamental drivers of germination. Therefore, it is highly probable that CCC genes are expressed and potentially regulated during these early stages, especially under environmental challenges.
*   **ABA/GA regulation of this gene:**
    *   There is no direct, widely established evidence in the literature demonstrating that *AtCCC1* (or its direct homologs) is a primary target directly regulated by ABA or GA during germination. However, many genes involved in stress responses and ion homeostasis are indirectly or directly modulated by these hormones. For instance, ABA is known to regulate genes involved in stress tolerance, and CCCs contribute to this. Further research would be needed to clarify direct hormonal regulation during germination.
*   **Dormancy-related functions:**
    *   No direct evidence links *AtCCC1* or its homologs to primary seed dormancy mechanisms (e.g., embryo dormancy or coat-imposed dormancy). Their role is more likely in post-dormancy germination success, particularly in overcoming environmental stresses that might otherwise prevent germination.

### 5. CROSS-KINGDOM RNA RELEVANCE

This is a more nascent and preliminary area of research for ion transporters.

*   **sRNA target:**
    *   While plant miRNAs are known to target various transporter genes (e.g., miR399 targeting PHO2, a phosphate transporter regulator), there is **no widely reported or established evidence** of *AtCCC1* (or its direct homologs) being a specific target of a known plant sRNA (miRNA or siRNA) that significantly modulates its expression or function. This does not preclude the possibility, but it's not a prominent finding in the literature.
*   **Evidence of cross-kingdom targeting of this gene family:**
    *   The concept of cross-kingdom RNA communication, where sRNAs from one organism affect gene expression in another, is an exciting but still emerging field, especially
