### 1. FUNCTION

*   **KNOWN FACTS**:
    *   The annotation "Cation/H(+) antiporter-like" strongly suggests a protein belonging to the Na+/H+ Exchanger (NHX) family or a related Cation/H+ antiporter family. These are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the exchange of a cation (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+) for a proton (H+) across biological membranes, driven by the electrochemical proton gradient established by H+-ATPases.
    *   In plants, NHX proteins are crucial for maintaining ion homeostasis, regulating cellular and vacuolar pH, and contributing to cell expansion and turgor. They are typically localized to the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane), plasma membrane, or endosomal membranes.
    *   Based on *Arabidopsis thaliana* homologs:
        *   **Vacuolar NHXs (e.g., AtNHX1, AtNHX2)**: Primarily involved in sequestering Na+ and K+ into the vacuole, contributing to osmotic adjustment, turgor, and maintaining cytosolic ion balance. They also play a role in vacuolar pH regulation.
        *   **Endosomal NHXs (e.g., AtNHX5, AtNHX6)**: Involved in regulating pH within endosomal compartments, which is critical for protein trafficking, sorting, and recycling.
        *   **Plasma membrane NHX (e.g., AtSOS1/NHX7)**: Primarily responsible
