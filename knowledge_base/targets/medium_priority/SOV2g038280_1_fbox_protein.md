## Analysis

The target gene SOV2g038280.1 is annotated as an F-box protein involved in protein turnover. F-box proteins are critical components of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are central to targeted protein degradation via the 26S proteasome. This process regulates nearly all aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses, including seed germination.

The observed phenotype is improved germination rate, vigor, and early seedling growth upon bacterial exRNA treatment, which is predicted to downregulate SOV2g038280.1. This implies that the normal function of SOV2g038280.1 is to *inhibit* germination/growth, or to
