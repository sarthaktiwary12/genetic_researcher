### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function of SOV4g011580.1

*   **KNOWN FACTS**: DNA polymerases are a large family of enzymes essential for synthesizing DNA. Their primary roles include DNA replication (duplicating the genome during cell division) and DNA repair (correcting damage to the DNA molecule).
*   **INFERRED CONCLUSIONS / UNCERTAINTY**: The annotation "DNA polymerase" is very broad. Plants, like other eukaryotes, possess numerous DNA polymerases (
