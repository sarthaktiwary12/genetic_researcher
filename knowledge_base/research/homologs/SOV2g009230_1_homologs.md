# Homolog Research: SOV2g009230.1 - Trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene **SOV2g009230.1**, annotated as a Trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS), is a key enzyme in the trehalose biosynthesis pathway. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), the product of TPS, is a crucial signaling molecule in plants, linking carbohydrate status to growth, development, and stress responses.

Here's a detailed analysis based on current literature:

### 1. Arabidopsis Homolog

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog of SOV2g009230.1 is **AT1G22070**, known as **Trehalose-6-phosphate Synthase 1 (AtTPS1)**.

*   **Gene Name and Locus ID**: *AtTPS1* (AT1G22070)
*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes**:
    *   **Embryonic Lethality**: *tps1* null mutants are embryo-lethal, arresting at the globular or heart stage of development, indicating its essential role in early embryogenesis (Eastmond et al., 2002, PNAS).
    *   **Sugar Sensing and Metabolism**: Conditional *tps1* mutants or weak alleles exhibit defects in sugar sensing, reduced starch accumulation, and altered carbon partitioning. They show hypersensitivity to glucose and sucrose (Schluepmann et al., 2003, PNAS; van Dijken et al., 2004, Plant J).
    *   **Developmental Defects**: Beyond embryogenesis, *tps1* mutants display pleiotropic developmental defects, including delayed flowering, altered root growth, and reduced biomass (van Dijken et al., 2004, Plant J; Martínez-Barajas et al., 2011, Plant Physiol).
    *   **Stress Response**: *AtTPS1* is involved in various stress responses, including drought, salt, and cold stress, likely through its role in T6P signaling and its interaction with SnRK1 (Nunes et al., 22013, J Exp Bot).
*   **Key Publications**:
    *   Eastmond, P. J., van Dijken, A. J. H., Slotte, S. J., Rensburg, S. A., Schuurmans, J. A. M. J., & Graham, I. A. (2002). Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 is essential for normal Arabidopsis embryogenesis. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 99(21), 13938-13943.
    *   Schluepmann, H., van Dijken, A., Lunn, J. E., & Stitt, M. (2003). Trehalose 6-phosphate is a non-metabolizable regulator of metabolism in Arabidopsis that acts as a signal for 'sugar' status. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 100(11), 6849-6854.

### 2. Other Model Species

TPS homologs are widely conserved across plant species, playing similar roles in metabolism, development, and stress responses.

*   **Rice (*Oryza sativa*)**:
    *   **Homolog**: *OsTPS1* (Os02g07900).
    *   **Phenotypes**: *OsTPS1* is involved in abiotic stress tolerance (drought, salinity, cold) and plays a role in regulating yield-related traits. Overexpression of *OsTPS1* can enhance stress tolerance and improve grain yield under certain conditions (Li et al., 2011, Plant Mol Biol; Shibata et al., 2017, Plant Cell Environ). While not directly linked to germination, its role in stress tolerance and early development suggests an indirect impact on seedling vigor.
*   **Tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*)**:
    *   **Homolog**: *SlTPS1* (Solyc06g069400).
    *   **Phenotypes**: *SlTPS1* has been implicated in fruit development and ripening, as well as responses to abiotic stress. Manipulating *SlTPS1* expression can alter sugar accumulation in fruits and influence stress tolerance (Cortes et al., 2019, Plant Cell Environ).
*   **Maize (*Zea mays*)**:
    *   **Homolog**: *ZmTPS1* (Zm00001d006120).
    *   **Phenotypes**: *ZmTPS1* is involved in drought tolerance. Overexpression of *ZmTPS1* can improve drought resistance in maize by altering sugar metabolism and osmotic adjustment (Nuccio et al., 2015, Plant Cell).

### 3. Functional Evidence (Primarily AtTPS1)

*   **Loss-of-Function (Knockout/Knockdown) Phenotypes**: As mentioned, *tps1* null mutants are embryo-lethal. Conditional knockdown or weak alleles show severe growth retardation, altered flowering time, reduced primary root growth, and impaired sugar signaling (Eastmond et al., 2002; Schluepmann et al., 2003; van Dijken et al., 2004). This highlights the essential and pleiotropic roles of T6P in plant development.
*   **Overexpression Phenotypes**: Overexpression of *AtTPS1* in *Arabidopsis* can lead to increased T6P levels, which can have complex effects. While moderate increases might enhance stress tolerance, very high T6P levels can be detrimental, leading to growth inhibition and altered carbon partitioning, suggesting a tightly regulated optimal range for T6P (Paul et al., 2008, J Exp Bot).
*   **Expression Patterns During Germination**: *AtTPS1* is expressed in developing embryos and young seedlings. T6P levels are dynamic during seed development, imbibition, and early seedling growth, indicating its active role in these critical stages. Its expression is responsive to sugar availability and various environmental cues (Lunn et al., 2006, Plant J).
*   **Protein Interaction Partners**:
    *   **Trehalose-6-phosphate Phosphatases (TPPs)**: AtTPS1 works in conjunction with Trehalose-6-phosphate Phosphatase (TPP) enzymes (e.g., AtTPPA, AtTPPB) to control the levels of T6P. TPS synthesizes T6P, and TPP dephosphorylates it to trehal
