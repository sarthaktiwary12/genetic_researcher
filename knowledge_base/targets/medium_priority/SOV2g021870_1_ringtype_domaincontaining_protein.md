### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   The annotation "RING-type domain-containing protein" strongly indicates that SOV2g021870.1 functions as an **E3 ubiquitin ligase**.
*   E3 ubiquitin ligases are key components of the **ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)**, which is responsible for tagging specific proteins with ubiquitin for degradation by the 26S proteasome.
*   The "protein_turnover" assigned pathway is consistent with this role, as the UPS is the primary system for regulated protein degradation in eukaryotic
