# Homolog Research: SOV6g029280.1 - 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PPP / NADPH)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PPP / NADPH)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV6g029280.1**, encoding a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), is a crucial component of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). This pathway is vital for generating NADPH, which is essential for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense, and for producing pentose phosphates for nucleotide synthesis.

Here's a detailed analysis of its homologs and functional relevance:
