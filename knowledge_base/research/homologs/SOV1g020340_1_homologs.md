> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for MYB transcription factor
> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene **SOV1g020340.1** is annotated as a MYB transcription factor. Based on sequence homology, its closest characterized homologs in *Arabidopsis thaliana* belong to the R2R3-MYB family, specifically those involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.

### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homologs of SOV1g020340.1 are:

*   **Gene Name and Locus ID**:
    *   **MYB29 (AT1G66390)**: This is typically the top hit in BLAST searches.
    *   **MYB76 (AT5G07690)** and **MYB28 (AT5G61420)**: These are also very close homologs and often function redundantly with MYB29. They belong to subgroup 12 of R2R3-MYB TFs.

*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related)**:
    *   **Primary Function**: MYB29, MYB28, and MYB76 are master regulators of **aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis** in *Arabidopsis*.
    *   **Loss-of-function (e.g., *myb29* mutants)**: Single *myb29* mutants show reduced levels of specific aliphatic glucosinolates. Double mutants, such as *myb28 myb29*, exhibit a dramatic reduction or complete absence of aliphatic glucosinolates (Gigolashvili et al., 2007, *The Plant Cell*; Sønderby et al., 2007, *Plant Physiology*).
    *   **Germination-related phenotypes**: Direct, primary roles in germination timing or success (e.g., dormancy breaking, radicle protrusion) have **not been prominently reported** for *myb29* or its close homologs. However, glucosinolates are secondary metabolites involved in plant defense. Their presence in seeds can deter herbivores and pathogens, which might indirectly influence seed survival and, consequently, germination success in ecological contexts. A direct regulatory role in the *process* of germination itself is not a major finding for these genes.
