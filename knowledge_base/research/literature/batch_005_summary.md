*   **SOV6g037890.1 | Medium | Modulating inhibitory signaling pathways (e.g., ABA-related) | Moderate**
*   **SOV3g008230.1 | Low | Suppressing a metabolic pathway that inhibits germination | Weak**
*   **SOV3g021300.1 | High | Reducing stress-induced inhibition, shifting resources to growth | Moderate**
*   **SOV3g038840.1 | High | Fine-tuning ROS balance or reducing cell wall stiffening | Moderate**
*   **SOV4g023530.1 | Medium | Modulating alternative splicing of key regulatory transcripts | Weak**
*   **SOV4g011580.1 | Low | Downregulation likely detrimental to cell division/growth | Weak**
*   **SOV4g022520.1 | Medium | Stabilizing pro-germination proteins or destabilizing anti-germination factors | Weak**
*   **SOV4g041000.1 | High | Altering transport of inhibitory hormones (e.g., ABA) or toxins | Moderate**

**Summary of Patterns:**

The most promising targets for germination improvement via downregulation are those involved in **stress response, ROS/redox balance, and transport**, as these are critical regulatory nodes in seed dormancy and germination. Downregulating general essential processes like DNA replication or broad metabolic enzymes is generally counterintuitive for promoting germination. The "unknown" targets highlight the need for functional characterization to assess their relevance.
