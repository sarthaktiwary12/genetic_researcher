VERIFICATION NOTES
================================================================================

Citations with full DOI verification (confirmed via publisher website or PubMed):
  36 out of 42 citations have confirmed DOIs.

Citations confirmed by journal/volume/page without explicit DOI link:
  - Delatorre-Herrera & Pinto 2009: Confirmed via SciELO Chile database
  - Rubio et al. 2008: Confirmed via Google Scholar citation records
  - Shabala & Mackay 2011: Confirmed via Google Scholar and ResearchGate

Citations NOT fabricated or included due to insufficient verification:
  - "Xu et al. 2023 small RNA pathways in quinoa" as described in the task prompt
    was not found under that author name. The closest verified match is Han et al. 2023
    (IJMS, DOI: 10.3390/ijms241411789) which covers quinoa transcriptome AND small RNA
    sequencing. This has been included as C5-5 with correct authorship.
  - The "Shen et al. 2006" GUN5 citation maps to the ABA receptor paper (Nature 443:823)
    rather than a retrograde signaling-specific study; the GUN5 retrograde signaling was
    established by Mochizuki et al. 2001 (PNAS) which is separate. The verified paper
    (Shen et al. 2006 Nature) is included as it does relate to CHLH/GUN5 function.
