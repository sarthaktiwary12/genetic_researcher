### 1. Arabidopsis Homolog

*   **Gene name and locus ID**: The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog is **ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 2 (EDR2)**, locus ID **AT3G13790**. This has been confirmed through sequence similarity searches (e.g., Phytozome).
*   **Known mutant phenotypes**:
    *   The primary and well-established phenotype of *edr2* loss-of-function mutants is **enhanced resistance to virulent powdery mildew** (e.g., *Erysiphe cichoracearum*). This is the basis for its name (Tang et al., 2
