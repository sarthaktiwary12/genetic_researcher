### 1. FUNCTION

*   **KNOWN FACTS**: SOV4g035080.1 is annotated as a **tRNA (G37)-N1-methyltransferase**. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of a methyl group to the N1 position of guanosine at position 37 (G37) in specific transfer RNAs (tRNAs). This modification is known as 1-methylguanosine (m1G37).
*   **INFERRED FUNCTION**: tRNA modifications are crucial post-transcriptional events that
