### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

*   **Gene Name and Locus ID**:
    *   **ETR1** (Ethylene Response 1) - **AT1G66340**
    *   *ETR1* is the founding member of the five-gene ethylene receptor family in *Arabidopsis* (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, EIN4). SOV3g000150.1 shows highest sequence similarity to *Arabidopsis ETR1* (84.7% identity) and *ERS1* (77.7% identity) based on BLASTP analysis against the *Arabidopsis* proteome. Both *ETR1* and *ERS1* are Type I ethylene receptors, characterized by an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a GAF domain, and a C-terminal histidine kinase domain.

*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related)**:
    *   **_etr1-1_ (dominant, gain-of-function)**: This is the most extensively studied allele. It confers constitutive ethylene insensitivity.
        *   **Germination**: _etr1-1_ seeds exhibit delayed or reduced germination, especially under conditions where ethylene promotes germination (e.g., in the presence of ABA or under stress). This is because the mutant receptor is locked in an active (ethylene-insensitive) state, preventing ethylene signaling (Bleecker et al., 1988, Science; Roman et al., 1995, Plant Cell).
        *   **Seedling**: Triple response (short hypocotyl, exaggerated apical hook, swollen radial roots) is absent even in the presence of ethylene.
        *   **Adult**: Plants are generally stunted, exhibit early senescence, and have altered flower and fruit development.
    *   **_etr1_ (recessive, loss-of-function)**: Recessive _etr1_ mutants show a mild ethylene-insensitive phenotype, often masked by redundancy with other ethylene receptors. However, higher-order mutants (e.g., _etr1-7;etr2-3;ein4-4;ers1-2;ers2-3_) are completely insensitive to ethylene (Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998, Plant Cell).

### 2. OTHER MODEL SPECIES

Ethylene receptors are highly conserved across the plant kingdom.

*   **Tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*)**:
    *   Tomato has at least six ethylene receptor genes (*LeETR1-6*, *LeERS1-2*).
    *   **_Never-ripe_ (NR)**: This is a classic dominant ethylene-insensitive mutant, resulting from a mutation in the *LeETR3* gene (Wilkinson et al., 1995, Nat Biotechnol).
        *   **Phenotypes**: _NR_ fruits fail to ripen, remaining green and firm. While primarily known for fruit ripening, ethylene also plays a role in tomato seed germination, and _NR_ mutants show altered germination responses, particularly under stress conditions or in the presence of germination inhibitors (Lashbrook et al., 1998, Plant Physiol).
    *   Other receptors like *LeETR1* and *LeETR2* also contribute to ethylene perception in various developmental processes, including germination and seedling growth (Klee, 2004, Trends Plant Sci).

*   **Rice (*Oryza sativa*)**:
    *   Rice has 11 ethylene receptor genes, including *OsETR1-4*, *OsERS1-2*, and *OsEIN4-like* genes (Wuriyanghan et al., 2009, Plant Cell).
    *   **_OsERS1_**: Involved in submergence tolerance, a critical trait for rice. Mutants show altered ethylene responses and sensitivity to submergence (Wuriyanghan et al., 2009, Plant Cell).
    *   **Germination/Seedling Vigor**: Ethylene is crucial for rice seed germination, especially under hypoxic conditions (e.g., during flooding). Ethylene receptor mutants often exhibit impaired germination under such stresses. For example, mutations in certain *OsETR* or *OsERS* genes can affect coleoptile elongation and overall seedling vigor under low oxygen (Mohanty et al., 2018, Plant Cell Rep).

*   **Other Crops**:
    *   Ethylene receptors are also characterized in other crops like maize, cucumber, and apple, where they play roles in fruit ripening, senescence, and stress responses. In cucumber, *CsETR1* is involved in sex determination (Li et al., 2201, Plant Cell).

### 3. FUNCTIONAL EVIDENCE (Primarily for *Arabidopsis ETR1*)

*   **Loss-of-function (knockout/knockdown) phenotypes**:
    *   Recessive _etr1_ mutants show ethylene insensitivity, but due to functional redundancy among the five receptors, single mutants often have subtle phenotypes.
    *   Higher-order mutants (e.g., _etr1-7;etr2-3;ein4-4;ers1-2;ers2-3_) are completely insensitive to ethylene, exhibiting a lack of triple response, insensitivity to ethylene in senescence, and altered flowering time (Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998, Plant Cell).
    *   These mutants also show impaired germination in the presence of ethylene, highlighting the role of these receptors in mediating ethylene's pro-germination effects.

*   **Overexpression phenotypes**:
    *   Overexpression of wild-type *ETR1* can lead to ethylene insensitivity, likely by increasing the number of active receptors that suppress the ethylene signaling pathway in the absence of ethylene (Chang et al., 1993, Science).
    *   Overexpression of the dominant _etr1-1_ allele confers strong ethylene insensitivity, mirroring the mutant phenotype.

*   **Expression patterns during germination**:
    *   *ETR1* is constitutively expressed throughout plant development, including during seed imbibition and germination (Chang et al., 1993, Science).
    *   Ethylene production and sensitivity are critical during seed imbibition and early germination. While *ETR1* expression itself might not be drastically regulated, its presence is essential for perceiving the ethylene signal that promotes germination.

*   **Protein interaction partners**:
    *   Ethylene receptors function as negative regulators of ethylene signaling. In the absence of ethylene, they are active and activate the **CTR1** (Constitutive Triple Response 1) kinase.
    *   **CTR1** then phosphorylates and inactivates **EIN2** (Ethylene Insensitive 2), preventing the downstream activation of **EIN3/EIL1** transcription factors.
    *   Upon ethylene binding, the receptors become inactive, leading to de-repression of CTR1, activation of EIN2, and subsequent activation of EIN3/EIL1, which then regulate ethylene response genes (Gao et al., 2003, Plant Cell; Ju et al., 2201, Nat Plants).
    *   Receptors also form homo- and hetero-dimers, influencing their activity and specificity (Schaller et al., 1995,
