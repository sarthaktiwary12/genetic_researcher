# Homolog Research: SOV4g032870.1 - Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1 (AHP-like)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1 (AHP-like)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene SOV4g032870.1, annotated as a "Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1 (AHP-like)," belongs to the Histidine Phosphotransfer (AHP) family, which are crucial components of the two-component signaling (TCS) system in plants. AHPs act as phosphorelay intermediates, primarily in cytokinin signaling, but also in other pathways like ethylene and osmosensing.

Given its annotation as "Histidine-containing," it is likely a functional AHP involved in phosphorelay, rather than a pseudo-AHP lacking the conserved histidine residue (like Arabidopsis AHP6).

### 1. Arabidopsis Homolog

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homologs are the **five canonical Histidine-containing Phosphotransfer proteins: AHP1, AHP2, AHP3, AHP4, and AHP5**. These proteins exhibit significant functional redundancy.

*   **Gene Names and Locus IDs:**
    *   **AHP1**: AT3G21510
    *   **AHP2**: AT5G51200
    *   **AHP3**: AT5G39180
    *   **AHP4**: AT3G16360
    *   **AHP5**: AT3G03400

*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related):**
    *   **General Phenotypes:** Due to high functional redundancy, single *ahp* mutants often show subtle or no obvious phenotypes. However, higher-order mutants (triple, quadruple, or quintuple) exhibit severe developmental defects. The *ahp1 ahp2 ahp3 ahp4 ahp5* quintuple mutant is **embryonic lethal**, demonstrating the essential role of AHPs in plant development (Hwang et al., 2002, *Plant Cell*).
    *   **Cytokinin Signaling:** AHPs are positive regulators of cytokinin signaling. Loss-of-function mutants show reduced sensitivity to cytokinin in various assays (e.g., root growth inhibition, shoot regeneration) (Ueguchi et al., 2001, *Plant Cell*; Hutchison et al., 2004, *Plant Cell*).
    *   **Germination-Related Phenotypes:**
        *   *ahp* mutants (e.g., *ahp1 ahp2 ahp3* triple mutants) exhibit **reduced germination rates** and **hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA)** during germination (Nishimura et al., 2004, *Plant Cell*). This is consistent with their role in cytokinin signaling, which generally promotes germination and antagonizes ABA.
        *   Conversely, these mutants show **reduced sensitivity to exogenous cytokinin** in promoting germination.

*   **Key Publications Characterizing this Gene Family:**
    *   **Ueguchi et al., 2001, Plant Cell:** Initial characterization of *Arabidopsis* AHPs, showing their role as phosphorelay intermediates in cytokinin signaling.
    *   **Hwang et al., 2002, Plant Cell:** Demonstrated the essentiality of AHPs, with the quintuple mutant being embryonic lethal.
    *   **Nishimura et al., 2004, Plant Cell:** Elucidated the role of AHPs in cytokinin signaling during various developmental processes, including germination and root development, and their interaction with ABA.
    *   **Hutchison et al., 2004, Plant Cell:** Showed AHPs are required for cytokinin action in the shoot meristem.
    *   **Riefler et al., 2006, Trends Plant Sci:** Review on cytokinin signaling, highlighting the role of AHPs.

### 2. Other Model Species Homologs

Homologs of AHPs are widely conserved across plant species, playing similar roles in cytokinin signaling and various developmental processes.

*   **Rice (Oryza sativa):**
    *   Rice has several AHP homologs, such as **OsAHP1 (Os03g0126000)** and **OsAHP2 (Os01g0917000)**.
    *   **Phenotypes:** *Osahp* mutants in rice show altered root architecture, reduced tiller number, and defects in grain development and yield, consistent with their role in cytokinin signaling (Mao et al., 2017, *Plant Cell Rep*; Sun et al., 2014, *J Integr Plant Biol*). While direct "germination" phenotypes are not always the primary focus in these studies, cytokinin is known to influence rice germination, so *Osahp* mutants would likely exhibit altered germination responses, particularly under stress conditions or in response to ABA/GA.

*   **Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum):**
    *   Tomato also possesses AHP homologs, e.g., **SlAHP1 (Solyc06g069350)** and **SlAHP2 (Solyc09g091010)**.
    *   **Phenotypes:** SlAHPs have been implicated in fruit development and ripening processes, reflecting the broad regulatory roles of cytokinin in plant development (Wang et al., 2015, *Plant Mol Biol Rep*). Specific germination or seedling vigor phenotypes for tomato *Slahp* mutants are less prominently reported in the literature, but their role in cytokinin signaling suggests an indirect influence on these processes.

*   **Other Crops:** AHPs are critical for growth, development, and stress responses in many crops, making them targets for genetic improvement. For example, in maize (*Zea mays*), ZmAHPs are involved in root development and drought stress responses (Zhang et al., 2018, *J Exp Bot*).

### 3. Functional Evidence

*   **Loss-of-Function (knockout/knockdown) Phenotypes:**
    *   As detailed above, *Arabidopsis* *ahp* mutants show reduced cytokinin sensitivity, developmental defects (e.g., altered root and shoot development, reduced growth), and embryonic lethality in higher-order mutants (Hwang et al., 2002; Ueguchi et al., 2001).
    *   Specifically, they are **hypersensitive to ABA** during germination and show **reduced germination rates** (Nishimura et al., 2004).

*   **Overexpression Phenotypes:**
    *   Overexpression of *AHPs* can sometimes lead to increased cytokinin sensitivity or altered developmental phenotypes, such as increased shoot regeneration or changes in root morphology, although these phenotypes can be complex due to feedback regulation within the cytokinin pathway (Kakimoto, 2003, *Annu Rev Plant Biol*). The effects are often less dramatic than loss-of-function due to the robust nature of the signaling network.

*   **Expression Patterns During Germination:**
    *   AHPs are generally expressed throughout plant tissues, including seeds and during germination. Cytokinin signaling is active during seed development, dormancy release, and germination. For instance, *Arabidopsis* AHP genes are expressed in imbibed seeds
