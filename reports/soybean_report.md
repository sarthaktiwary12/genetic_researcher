## Executive Summary

This report presents the analysis of **18 predicted exRNA targets** in
Glycine max (soybean). These transcripts were identified as potential
targets of bacterial extracellular small RNAs (exRNAs) that may improve seed germination
and seedling vigor when seeds are treated with M-9 bacterial EPS solution.
