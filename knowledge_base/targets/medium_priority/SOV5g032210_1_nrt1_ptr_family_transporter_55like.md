### **1. FUNCTION: NRT1/PTR family transporter 5.5-like**

*   **KNOWN FACTS**:
    *   The NRT1/PTR family (NPF) is a large superfamily of secondary active transporters found in plants. They are involved in the transport of a wide array of substrates, including nitrate, peptides, amino acids, and phytohormones (e.g., ABA, GA, auxin).
    *   Members of this family are crucial for nutrient acquisition, long-distance transport, and signal transduction throughout the plant.
*   **INFERRED CONCLUSIONS (from "5.5-like
