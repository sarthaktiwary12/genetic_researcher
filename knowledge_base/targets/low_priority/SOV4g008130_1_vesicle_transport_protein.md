### **1. FUNCTION**

*   **KNOWN (Spinach Annotation):** SOV4g008130.1 is annotated as a "Vesicle transport protein" and assigned to the "transport_ion_homeostasis" pathway.
*   **INFERRED (General Plant Biology):** Vesicle transport proteins are fundamental components of the eukaryotic endomembrane system. They are involved in the budding, movement, and fusion of vesicles, which are essential for:
    *   Protein secretion and delivery to the plasma membrane.
    *   Endocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins (e.g., receptors, transporters).
    *   Trafficking to and from the vacuole (storage, degradation, ion homeostasis).
    *   Cell plate formation during cytokinesis.
    *   Autophagy.
*   **SPECULATIVE (Specific Role based on "ion homeostasis
