### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function of SOV5g013920.1

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   **CRM-domain proteins:** The Chloroplast RNA Splicing and Ribosome Maturation (CRM) domain is a conserved RNA-binding domain found in proteins primarily involved in RNA processing within plant organelles (chloroplasts and mitochondria). These processes include splicing of group II introns, RNA editing, and ribosome assembly/maturation.
*   **CFM3 (Chloroplast Factor for mRNA processing 3):** In *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the homolog AtCFM3 (At3g55900) is a well-characterized CRM-domain protein. It is localized to both chloroplasts and mitochondria.
*   **Organelle Biogenesis:** CRM-domain proteins, including CFM3, are critical for the proper biogenesis and function of chloroplasts and mitochondria by ensuring the correct processing of their encoded transcripts. This includes transcripts for components of photosynthetic and respiratory machinery, as well as ribosomal RNAs.
*   **Loss-of-function phenotypes:** Mut
