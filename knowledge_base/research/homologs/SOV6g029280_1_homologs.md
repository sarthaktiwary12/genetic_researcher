# Homolog Research: SOV6g029280.1 - 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PPP / NADPH)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PPP / NADPH)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene **SOV6g029280.1** is annotated as a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), a key enzyme in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This pathway is crucial for producing NADPH, which is essential for reductive biosynthesis and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, and for generating precursors for nucleotide synthesis.

Here's a detailed analysis based on its homologs in model and crop species:
