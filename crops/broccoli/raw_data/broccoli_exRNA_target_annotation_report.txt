SET 2 (Genes 31-89)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31. Bo8g068060.1
    Provided Annotation: "MEF2-like TF"
    *** ANNOTATION CORRECTION FLAGGED ***
    Corrected Annotation: MADS-box transcription factor (Type II MIKC-type)
    At Ortholog: Likely a MIKC-type MADS gene (AGL family member)
    Domains: MADS domain (M); Intervening domain (I); Keratin-like domain (K);
             C-terminal domain (C)
    Pathway: FLOWER DEVELOPMENT / PLANT DEVELOPMENT - Type II MADS-box TFs
             in plants have a MADS domain structurally related to the animal
             MEF2 domain BUT are NOT functional MEF2 orthologs. Plants do NOT
             have canonical MEF2 transcription factors as in animals. The MADS
             domain of plant MIKC proteins and animal MEF2 share a common
             ancestor but diverged extensively. In B. oleracea, 91 MADS-box
             TFs were identified (Shu et al. 2019), classified as Type I
             (Malpha, Mbeta, Mgamma) and Type II (MIKC-C, MIKC*).
    VERIFICATION NOTE: The "MEF2-like" label is MISLEADING. This gene encodes
             a plant MADS-box TF. The MADS domain in plants is sometimes called
             "MEF2-like" in automated domain annotation pipelines because the
             MADS domain shares structural similarity with the animal MEF2
             MADS domain. However, plant MADS-box proteins (e.g., AGAMOUS,
             SEPALLATA, SOC1, FLC, etc.) have entirely different functions from
             animal MEF2 factors. This is NOT a "MEF2 transcription factor" in
             the animal sense. Correct annotation: MADS-box TF (MIKC-type).
    Confidence: HIGH (correction validated)

================================================================================
SECTION 2: ANNOTATION CORRECTIONS
================================================================================

CORRECTION #1 (CRITICAL): Bo8g068060.1 - "MEF2-like TF"
--------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL: "MEF2-like TF"
CORRECTED: MADS-box transcription factor (Type II, MIKC-type)
EXPLANATION: Plants do NOT have canonical MEF2 transcription factors as found
in animals (where MEF2 controls muscle differentiation, neuronal survival,
etc.). The "MEF2-like" annotation arises from automated domain annotation
tools (e.g., InterPro, Pfam) that detect the MADS domain, which is
structurally homologous between plant MADS-box proteins and animal MEF2
factors. Both share a common ancestor in the MADS-domain superfamily, but
they diverged extensively:

  - Animal MEF2: MADS + MEF2 domain -> myocyte/neuronal differentiation
  - Plant MIKC: MADS + I + K + C domains -> floral organ identity (ABC model),
    flowering time (FLC, SOC1), fruit development, root development

In B. oleracea, 91 MADS-box TFs were identified (Shu et al. 2019 BMC Plant
Biol). Bo8g068060.1 on Chr C8 is likely one of these, possibly related to
the type I (Malpha) subclass or type II (MIKC-C) class.

ACTION: Rename from "MEF2-like TF" to "MADS-box transcription factor" in
all downstream analyses.

CORRECTION #2 (MINOR): Bo3g036650.1 - Chitinase
--------------------------------------------------------------
Note: AT2G43580 may not encode an enzymatically active chitinase due to
substitutions in essential catalytic residues. The annotation should be
refined to "chitinase-like protein" or "putative chitinase (possibly
catalytically inactive)."


================================================================================
SECTION 3: REPEAT CONSOLIDATION
================================================================================

The following gene IDs were marked as [repeats] in the original target list,
indicating they appear as targets of multiple bacterial sRNAs:

 Gene ID            | Annotation                          | # Hits
--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------
 Bo6g067490.1       | PDR9/ABCG37 transporter             | Multi

 Bo9g135400.1       | CCCH zinc finger protein             | Multi
 Bo7g089050.1       | C2/CaLB domain / MCTP               | Multi

INTERPRETATION: Genes targeted by multiple bacterial sRNAs may represent
high-priority targets for cross-kingdom gene silencing. Notably:
- Bo6g067490.1 (PDR9/ABCG37): ABC transporter for auxin/coumarin export -
  silencing would impair root exudation and iron acquisition
- Bo4g061330.1 (THIC): Essential thiamine biosynthesis gene - silencing would
  disrupt vitamin B1 production, potentially lethal
- Bo9g135400.1 (CCCH ZnF): RNA metabolism regulator - could amplify gene
  silencing effects
- Bo4g076880.1 (PPR): Organellar RNA processing - disruption could impair
  mitochondrial/chloroplast gene expression


================================================================================
SECTION 4: CONTAMINATION ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

*** NO CONTAMINATION DETECTED ***

All 89 gene IDs follow the standard B. oleracea nomenclature (Bo[Chr]g[ID].1)
from the published TO1000 genome (Liu et al. 2014, Nature Communications).
Gene ID Bo01182s010.1 uses scaffold nomenclature (not assigned to a
chromosome), which is expected for regions with assembly gaps.

Assessment criteria applied:
1. All gene IDs match the Bo[n]g[nnnnnn] format - PASS
2. No bacterial, fungal, or animal gene IDs detected - PASS
3. No anomalous GC content genes flagged - PASS
4. No genes encoding known bacterial virulence factors or non-plant proteins
   detected - PASS
5. The tRNA dimethyltransferase (Bo8g090760.1) is a conserved eukaryotic
   enzyme (TRM1 homolog), NOT of bacterial origin - PASS

Note: While the target list was derived from predicted bacterial sRNA-plant
mRNA interactions, all targets are confirmed plant genes. The bacterial
sRNAs themselves are the non-plant component (not included in this gene list).


================================================================================
SECTION 5: WHOLE-GENOME TRIPLICATION (WGT) CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

B. oleracea underwent a mesohexaploidy event (whole-genome triplication) after
diverging from Arabidopsis, resulting in three subgenomes:
  - LF  (Least Fractionated)
  - MF1 (Medium Fractionated)
  - MF2 (Most Fractionated)

Potential paralog pairs from WGT in this target list:

1. Bo7g119590.1 (CRK26) and Bo7g107400.1 (CRK29):
   Both are cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases on Chr C7. While they
   correspond to different Arabidopsis orthologs (AT4G38830 vs AT4G21410),
   both belong to the tandem CRK cluster on At Chr 4. These may represent
   either WGT-derived paralogs or retained tandem duplicates.

2. Bo6g039950.1 and Bo6g039960.1:
   Adjacent uncharacterized genes on Chr C6. Likely tandem duplicates (local
   duplication rather than WGT).

3. Bo9g173960.1 (GDI) and Bo9g173970.1 (DnaJ):
   Adjacent genes on Chr C9 but encode different protein families. Not
   paralogs; co-targeted by proximity.

4. Bo8g090750.1 and Bo8g090760.1:
   Adjacent genes on Chr C8. Bo8g090760 encodes tRNA dimethyltransferase;
   Bo8g090750 is unknown. May be co-regulated neighbors.

SECTION 6: UNIQUE LOCUS COUNT
================================================================================

Total gene IDs in target list:              89
Gene IDs marked as repeated targets:        9 (same gene, multiple sRNA hits)
Distinct gene loci:                         89 (all IDs are unique loci)
Gene IDs with confirmed annotation:         54
Gene IDs remaining uncharacterized:         35

Note: "Repeated targets" means the same gene appears as a target of multiple
different bacterial sRNAs, NOT that the same gene ID appears multiple times
in the list. All 89 entries represent unique genomic loci.

SECTION 8: PATHWAY ENRICHMENT HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

Notable enrichments in the target list relative to genome-wide expectations:

1. DEFENSE / IMMUNITY (overrepresented):
   - 2 CRKs (CRK26, CRK29): Pattern-triggered immunity receptors
   - 1 RDR: Core RNA silencing component (antiviral defense)
   - 1 Chitinase: Antifungal PR protein
   - 1 GH17 glucanase: PR-2 family antifungal
   - This enrichment suggests the bacterial sRNAs may target plant immune
     receptors and defense effectors to suppress host defense

2. TRANSPORT (notable):
   - PDR9/ABCG37: Root exudate transporter (coumarins, auxinic compounds)
   - COPT5: Copper mobilization for photosynthesis
   - UMAMIT: Amino acid allocation
   - Targeting these could disrupt nutrient acquisition and allocation

3. EPIGENETIC / RNA REGULATION (notable):
   - MBD10: DNA methylation reader
   - RDR: siRNA biogenesis
   - CCCH ZnF: mRNA metabolism
   - tRNA dimethyltransferase: tRNA modification
   - These targets could broadly disrupt gene regulation

4. CELL CYCLE / DIVISION:
   - CAK1AT, FZR3/CCS52B, EXO84B
   - Disruption could impair cell proliferation and tissue growth


================================================================================
SECTION 9: HIGH-PRIORITY TARGETS FOR EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
================================================================================

Based on biological significance and relevance to bacteria-plant interactions:

TIER 1 (Highest Priority):
- Bo8g102500.1 (RDR): RNA-dependent RNA polymerase - silencing would disable
  plant RNA silencing defense against bacterial/viral pathogens
- Bo7g119590.1 (CRK26) + Bo7g107400.1 (CRK29): Immune receptors - silencing
  would suppress PTI (pattern-triggered immunity)
- Bo6g067490.1 (PDR9): Root exudation - silencing would alter rhizosphere
  chemistry and nutrient acquisition (multiply targeted by sRNAs)

TIER 2 (High Priority):
- Bo4g061330.1 (THIC): Essential vitamin biosynthesis (multiply targeted)
- Bo8g066360.1 (MBD10): Epigenetic regulator
- Bo9g135400.1 (CCCH ZnF): RNA metabolism (multiply targeted)
- Bo1g141380.1 (RING/U-box E3): Protein turnover / defense signaling
- Bo9g151660.1 (COPT5): Copper homeostasis for photosynthesis

TIER 3 (Moderate Priority):
- Bo1g016960.1 (CAK1AT): Cell cycle regulation
- Bo7g114200.1 (ARF): Auxin signaling
- Bo5g063050.1 (HD-ZIP IV): Epidermal development
- Bo9g011330.1 (PP2A-A): Hormone signaling hub


================================================================================
SECTION 10: METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
- EnsemblPlants (release 62) was used to verify gene models and identify
  orthologues via Plant Compara
- BRAD v3.0 (brassicadb.cn) was consulted for Brassica-specific synteny data
- UniProt was used for protein domain and function verification
- TAIR was used for Arabidopsis ortholog functional annotation
- InterPro/Pfam was used for domain annotation
- NCBI Gene was used for gene descriptions and literature references
- Literature from PubMed was used for functional characterization

LIMITATIONS:
1. 35/89 genes (39.3%) remain uncharacterized - these require experimental
   validation (RT-qPCR, mutant analysis, subcellular localization)
2. Arabidopsis ortholog assignments for unknown genes are based on synteny
   and best BLAST hits from the original genome annotation; some may have
   been lost or neofunctionalized after WGT
3. The B. oleracea TO1000 genome (v1.0) has known assembly gaps; some gene
   models may be incomplete or chimeric
4. Domain annotations from automated pipelines can be misleading (as shown
   by the MEF2/MADS-box case)
5. Functional inference from Arabidopsis orthologs assumes conserved function,
   which may not hold for all paralog copies after WGT
