### Analysis of SOV1g033340.1: DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase

**1. FUNCTION**

*   **KNOWN FACTS**: DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a conserved family of enzymes responsible for catalyzing the addition of a methyl group to the 5-carbon position of cytosine residues in DNA. This epigenetic modification, known as DNA methylation, plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, silencing transposable elements, and maintaining genome stability in plants.
*   **INFERRED (from Arabidopsis homologs)**: In *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the major classes of DNMTs include:
    *   **MET1 (Methyltransferase 1)**: Primarily responsible for maintaining CG methylation patterns during DNA replication. It is homologous to mammalian Dnmt1.
    *   **CMT3 (Chromomethylase 3)**: Maintains CHG methylation (where H can be A, T, or C). This enzyme is plant-specific.
    *   **DRM1/2 (DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 1/2)**: Establishes *de novo* methylation in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH), often guided by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. It is homologous to mammalian Dnmt3.
    *   **CMT2 (Chromomethylase 2)**: Maintains CHH methylation, particularly in heterochromatic regions.
*   **UNCERTAINTY IN ANNOTATION**: The annotation "DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase" is broad. Without further sequence analysis (e.g., phylogenetic comparison to identify specific domains or closest homologs in Arabidopsis), it is uncertain which specific class (e.g., MET1-like, DRM2-like) SOV
