### 1. FUNCTION

*   **KNOWN FACTS**: ULP_PROTEASE stands for Ubiquitin-Like Protease. These are a class of cysteine proteases that specifically cleave ubiquitin-like (UBL) modifiers (such as SUMO, NEDD8, ATG8, etc.) from their target proteins, or process the UBL modifiers themselves. They are crucial for reversing UBL modifications, thereby regulating protein stability, activity, localization, and interaction
