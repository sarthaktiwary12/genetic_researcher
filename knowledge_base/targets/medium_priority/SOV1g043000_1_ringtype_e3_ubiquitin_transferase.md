### 1. FUNCTION: RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   E3 ubiquitin ligases are key components of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), which is a major pathway for regulated protein degradation in eukaryotes.
*   They catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 conjugating enzyme to specific target proteins, marking them for degradation by the 26S proteasome.
*   RING (Really Interesting New Gene) E3 ligases are
