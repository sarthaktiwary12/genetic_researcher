# Homolog Research: SOV3g035520.1 - Lipoxygenase (LOX)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Lipoxygenase (LOX)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene SOV3g035520.1 is annotated as a Lipoxygenase (LOX). Plant LOXs are a diverse family of non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases that catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid. The products, hydroperoxy fatty acids, are precursors to a wide array of oxylipin signaling molecules, including jasmonates, divinyl ethers, and aldehydes, which play crucial roles in plant development, stress responses, and defense against pests and pathogens. Given its "chloroplastic" putative annotation (often associated with 9-LOXs), we will focus on Arabidopsis 9-LOXs.

Here's a detailed analysis:

### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

Based on sequence similarity and functional annotation (putative chloroplastic LOX, often indicative of 9-LOX activity), the closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homologs are likely members of the **9-LOX family**. Specifically, **LOX1 (AT1G55020)** and **LOX5 (AT3G22400)** are the primary 9-LOXs in *Arabidopsis*.

*   **Gene Name and Locus ID:**
    *   **LOX1 (AT1G55020)**: Lipoxygenase 1
    *   **LOX5 (AT3G22400)**: Lipoxygenase 5
    *   *Note:* While a precise BLAST search would confirm the single closest homolog, SOV3g035520.1 is likely to cluster with these 9-LOXs due to its predicted chloroplastic localization and general LOX function.

*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related):**
    *   **LOX1 (AT1G55020):**
        *   **Developmental:** *lox1* mutants exhibit altered root development, including reduced root hair formation and density (Vellosillo et al., 2010).
        *   **Defense:** Impaired resistance to certain pathogens, such as the oomycete *Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis* and some bacterial pathogens like *Pseudomonas syringae* (Vellosillo et al., 2010; Chini et al., 2018).
        *   **Abiotic Stress:** Involved in responses to salt stress and drought (Chini et al., 2018).
        *   **Seed Longevity/Vigor:** *lox1* mutants have been shown to have reduced seed longevity, impacting germination capacity after prolonged storage or under adverse conditions (Vellosillo et al., 2010). While not a direct germination defect under optimal conditions, reduced vigor and longevity can manifest as impaired germination rates or slower establishment under stress.
    *   **LOX5 (AT3G22400):**
        *   Often shows partially redundant functions with LOX1, particularly in root development and defense responses (Vellosillo et al., 2010).
        *   Double mutants (*lox1 lox5*) often exhibit more pronounced phenotypes than single mutants, highlighting their overlapping roles.
