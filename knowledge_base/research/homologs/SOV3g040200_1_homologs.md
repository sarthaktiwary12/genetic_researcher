# Homolog Research: SOV3g040200.1 - Glutathione S-transferase L3-like
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Glutathione S-transferase L3-like
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV3g040200.1**, annotated as a "Glutathione S-transferase L3-like," belongs to the large and diverse Glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily. These enzymes play crucial roles in detoxification of xenobiotics and endogenous toxic compounds, as well as in various stress responses, hormone signaling, and development in plants. The "L3-like" designation likely refers to a specific phylogenetic clade within the GST superfamily, often associated with the Tau (GSTU) class.

Here's a detailed analysis based on current literature:

### 1. Arabidopsis Homolog

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog to SOV3g040200.1, based on sequence similarity (e.g., BLASTP against Phytozome 13), is:

*   **Gene Name**: **Glutathione S-transferase U6 (GSTU6)**
*   **Locus ID**: **AT1G02930**

This gene exhibits high sequence identity (approx. 79.5%) and strong similarity to SOV3g040200.1. GSTU6 is a member of the Tau class (GSTU) of GSTs, which is the largest and most diverse class in plants. Other very close paralogs include AT1G02920 (GSTU5) and AT1G02940 (GSTU7), which are clustered together on chromosome 1.
