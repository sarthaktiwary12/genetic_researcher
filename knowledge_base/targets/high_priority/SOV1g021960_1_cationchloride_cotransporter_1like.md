### 1. FUNCTION: Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like

**Known Facts (from model plants/general biology):**
*   Cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) are membrane proteins belonging to the SLC12A family. They mediate the electroneutral transport of Cl- along with K+ and/or Na+ across biological membranes.
*   In plants, CCCs are known to play crucial roles in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis, turgor regulation, and osmoregulation. They are often involved in loading/unloading ions into/from vacuoles or xylem/phloem.
*   The *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog AtCCC1 (At5g48180) is a well-studied K+/Cl- cotransporter. It has been implicated in K+ and Cl- homeostasis, particularly under salinity stress, contributing to ion sequestration and distribution within the plant. It is thought to transport K+ and Cl- into vacuoles or xylem.

**Inferred Conclusions (for SOV1g021960.1):**
*   Based on the "Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like" annotation, SOV1g021960.1 is highly likely to be a homolog of AtCCC1.
*   It is predicted to function as a K+/Cl- cotransporter, mediating the movement of K+ and Cl- across cellular membranes in spinach.
*   Its primary role would be in regulating cellular ion concentrations, contributing to osmotic potential and cell turgor.

**Uncertainty in Annotation:**
*   The "like" in the annotation indicates homology but does not guarantee identical substrate specificity (e.g., K+ vs. Na+) or precise cellular localization/directionality of transport compared to AtCCC1. Direct functional characterization in spinach is lacking. However, the general function
