#### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function

**KNOWN FACTS (General ABC Transporters):**
ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters constitute one of the largest superfamilies of membrane proteins, found in all kingdoms of life. They are primary active transporters, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to move a diverse array of substrates across biological membranes. In plants, ABC transporters are involved in:
*   **Hormone transport**: Crucial for the distribution and homeostasis of phytohormones like abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins, and brassinosteroids (BRs).
*   **Xenobiotic detoxification**: Transporting herbicides, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds.
*   **Lipid and secondary metabolite transport**: Including waxes, suberin, pigments, and defense compounds.
*   **Nutrient uptake and efflux**.
*   **Ion homeostasis**: While many ABC transporters transport organic molecules, some can indirectly or directly influence ion gradients or transport specific ions.

**INFERRED CONCLUSIONS (SOV1g032780.1):**
Given the broad annotation "ABC transporter-like protein" and "transport_ion_homeostasis", SOV1g032780.1 likely functions as a membrane transporter. Without specific subfamily information (e.g., ABCB, ABCC, ABCD, ABCG), pinpointing its exact substrate is
