### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function of SOV2g000800.1

**KNOWN FACTS (General TPTs):**
*   **TPT domain proteins** (Triose Phosphate Transporters) are a well-characterized family of solute carriers in plants. The most common and studied TPTs are located in the chloroplast envelope.
*   Their primary function is to **export triose phosphates** (dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) from the chloroplast, where they are produced by photosynthesis, to the cytosol.
*   In the cytosol, triose phosphates are used for **sucrose synthesis**, which is the primary transport sugar in plants, and other metabolic pathways. This export is crucial for linking chloroplast carbon fixation with cytosolic metabolism and whole-plant growth.
*   **Arabidopsis TPT (AtTPT)** is a canonical example, essential for photoautotrophic growth. *AtTPT* mutants are sugar-dependent and exhibit impaired growth under normal light conditions (Flügge et al., 1999).

**INFERRED CONCLUSIONS / UNCERTAINTY (SOV2g000800.1 specific):**
*   The annotation "TPT domain-containing protein" strongly suggests a role in **solute transport**, likely related to carbon metabolism or phosphate.
*   However, the assigned pathway "transport_ion_homeostasis" introduces a significant point of uncertainty. Canonical TPTs transport carbon metabolites, not typically ions. This discrepancy could mean:
    *   **Non-canonical TPT function
