#### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   **Lysine-tRNA ligase (KRS)** is an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS). Its canonical function is to catalyze the attachment of the amino acid lysine to its cognate tRNA(Lys), forming Lysyl-tRNA. This is a crucial and essential step in protein synthesis (translation).
*   In plants, as in other eukaryotes, aaRSs typically exist as multiple isoforms, often with distinct subcellular localizations:
    *   **Cytosolic isoforms** are responsible for protein
