### Analysis of SOV5g001320.1: CTP Synthase

**1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function of this Gene**

*   **KNOWN**: CTP synthase (CTPS, EC 6.3.4.2) catalyzes the ATP-dependent amination of UTP to CTP, using glutamine as the nitrogen donor. This is a crucial and often rate-limiting step in the *de novo* pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway.
*   **KNOWN**: CTP is a fundamental precursor for various essential biological molecules:
