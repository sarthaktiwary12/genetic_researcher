### 1. FUNCTION: Glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   **Enzyme Activity**: Glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GHR; EC 1.1.1.26/79) is a dual-function enzyme that catalyzes two key reactions:
    1.  The NADH-dependent reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate.
    2.  The NADH/NADPH-dependent reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate.
