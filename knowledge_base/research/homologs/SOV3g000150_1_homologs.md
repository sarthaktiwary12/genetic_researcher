# Homolog Research: SOV3g000150.1 - Ethylene receptor
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Ethylene receptor
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The *Spinacia oleracea* gene SOV3g000150.1 is annotated as an "ethylene receptor 1-like" protein. This places it within the well-characterized family of ethylene receptors, which are crucial for perceiving the gaseous hormone ethylene in plants. Ethylene plays diverse roles in plant development, including seed germination, seedling establishment, growth, senescence, and stress responses.
