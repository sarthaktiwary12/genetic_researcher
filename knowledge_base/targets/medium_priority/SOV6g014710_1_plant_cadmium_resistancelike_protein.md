### 1. FUNCTION: Plant Cadmium Resistance-like protein (SOV6g014710.1)

**Known/Predicted Function:**
The annotation "Plant cadmium resistance-like protein" strongly suggests that SOV6g014710.1 belongs to a family of transporters involved in heavy metal homeostasis. In *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the Plant Cadmium Resistance (PCR) gene family (e.g., AtPCR1-AtPCR6) encodes proteins that primarily function as efflux transporters, moving heavy metals (such as Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), and Iron (
