### Analysis of SOV4g055600.1: Cytochrome P450

**1. FUNCTION**

*   **KNOWN:** Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) constitute a vast and diverse superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins found in all domains of life. In plants, P450s are involved in an enormous array of metabolic processes, typically catalyzing hydroxylation reactions. Their primary roles include:
    *   **Hormone Biosynthesis and Catabolism:** P450s are crucial for the synthesis and inactivation of various plant hormones, including gibberellins (GAs), brassinosteroids (BRs), abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, jasmonates (JAs), and salicylic acid (SA).
    *   **Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis:** They are key enzymes in the synthesis of a wide range of secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, lignins, alkaloids, terpenoids, glucosinolates, and phytoalexins. Many of these compounds play roles in plant defense, pigmentation, and stress responses.
    *   **Detoxification:** P450s are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics (herbicides, pollutants) and endogenous toxic compounds.
*   **INFERRED (from general annotation):
