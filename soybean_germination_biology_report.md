## 1. SOYBEAN SEED GERMINATION PHYSIOLOGY

### 1.1 ABA/GA Balance in Soybean

The balance between abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GA) is the central hormonal axis controlling soybean seed germination. When the ABA/GA ratio is high, seeds remain dormant; a lower ratio promotes germination. Quantitative measurements in soybean show that dry seeds contain approximately 32 ng g-1 ABA and undetectably low GA levels. After 6 hours of imbibition in water, active GA1 and GA4 increase to 0.6 and 0.4 ng g-1, respectively, while ABA concentration drops to approximately 14 ng g-1 (Shuai et al., 2017; Gazara et al., 2019).

Transcriptome analysis of soybean embryonic axes during germination in the presence of paclobutrazol (a GA biosynthesis inhibitor) confirmed that GA is a key positive regulator and revealed extensive hormonal crosstalk, with genes involved in brassinosteroid (BR), auxin, jasmonic acid, ABA, and cytokinin signaling being differentially expressed during germination (Gazara et al., 2019). A companion transcriptomics study identified cell wall metabolism genes and several hormone biosynthesis and signaling genes modulated during soybean axis germination, underscoring intensive hormonal crosstalk (Bellieny-Rabelo et al., 2016).

### 1.2 Role of Ethylene and Auxin in Soybean Germination

**Ethylene:** Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the soybean embryonic axis after imbibition induce the production of endogenous ethylene, which in turn promotes cell elongation in the root tip. Ethylene thus serves as a critical link between ROS signaling and the physical growth response during germination (Ishibashi et al., 2013).

**Auxin:** Exogenous auxin treatment represses soybean seed germination by enhancing ABA biosynthesis while impairing GA biogenesis, ultimately decreasing both GA1/ABA and GA4/ABA ratios. Microscope observations confirmed that auxin treatment delayed rupture of the soybean seed coat and radicle protrusion. Transcription of genes in the ABA biosynthetic pathway was up-regulated by auxin application, while expression of genes in the GA biosynthetic pathway was down-regulated (Shuai et al., 2017).

Further work has shown that the auxin and ABA signaling cascades converge on the regulation of plasma membrane H+-ATPases in the germinating soybean embryonic axis. IAA, 2,4-D, and ABA each affected H+-ATPase functioning, thereby delaying or inhibiting germination through modulation of acid growth (reported in MDPI Stresses, 2023).

### 1.3 Seed Reserve Mobilization

#### 1.3.1 Storage Proteins (7S and 11S Globulins)

The abundant seed storage proteins of soybean -- the salt-soluble globulins -- are grouped into 7S (beta-conglycinin, vicilin type) and 11S (glycinin, legumin type), which together comprise approximately 70-80% of total seed protein. During germination, these proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs).

The subtilisin-like serine protease known as soybean protease C1 initiates proteolysis of storage proteins and is localized to the PSVs of cotyledon parenchyma cells. Since protease C1 requires acidic conditions, PSV acidification -- which begins approximately 24 hours after imbibition -- is a critical control point. PSV acidification is mediated by vacuolar membrane proton pumps (H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase); imidodiphosphate (IDP), a non-hydrolyzable pyrophosphatase substrate analog, strongly inhibited PSV acidification and storage protein mobilization (He et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2016).

The degradation of beta-conglycinin (7S) proceeds faster than that of glycinin (11S), with the alpha and alpha-prime subunits of beta-conglycinin largely disappearing by 96 hours, while the beta subunits degrade at the slowest rate. The acidic subunits of glycinin are rapidly degraded, but no obvious change occurs in the basic chains (Kim et al., 2011).

Soybean mutants lacking abundant storage proteins (BSH-2 line, lacking alpha-prime and alpha subunits of beta-conglycinin and several glycinin subunits) show significantly lower germination rates and slower rates of storage protein mobilization compared with parent lines, demonstrating that seed protein composition directly affects germination performance (Wei et al., 2020).

#### 1.3.2 Oil Bodies and Triacylglycerol Mobilization

Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the principal lipid components of soybean seed oil bodies. Mobilization of TAG is initiated by seedling-specific TAG lipases that liberate fatty acids, which are then converted to acetyl-CoA units via beta-oxidation in the peroxisome. Acetyl-CoA is ultimately converted to sugars through the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis.

Four soybean genes encoding TAG lipases homologous to Arabidopsis SDP1 (SUGAR DEPENDENT1) have been identified: GmSDP1-1, GmSDP1-2, GmSDP1-3, and GmSDP1-4. During seed germination, after 1 day of imbibition, expression of GmSDP1-4, GmSDP1-1, and GmSDP1-3 increased by 4-, 3-, and 2-fold, respectively. TAG lipases are located in oil body membranes, and substrate specificity experiments showed preferential cleavage of oleic acid over linoleic acid (Kanai et al., 2019).

### 1.4 Imbibition Phases and Timing

Soybean seed germination follows the classic three-phase water uptake model:

**Phase I (Imbibition):** Rapid water uptake occurs typically within 6-24 hours. Water entry into permeable seeds commences within 10 minutes, enters a more linear phase between 240-540 minutes, and begins to plateau after approximately 840 minutes. Seeds absorb up to 25-30% of their dry weight in water within the first few hours, causing seed coat softening and swelling. Imbibition occurs as a two-phase process: the first dominated by hydration of the seed coat, and the second by hydration of the cotyledons (which is rate-limited by the coat) (Meyer et al., 2007).

**Phase II (Lag/Osmotic Phase):** Much slower water uptake occurs as the seed enters a metabolic plateau. During this phase, soybean seedlings are tolerant of soil temperatures as low as 35-40 degrees Fahrenheit, and metabolic reactivation processes take place.

**Phase III (Post-germination):** Water uptake increases again coincident with radicle elongation and emergence. In soybean, radicle elongation occurs after approximately 24 hours of immersion in water at 25 degrees Celsius.

### 1.5 Cell Wall Loosening in Legume Seeds

Cell wall loosening is essential for embryo cell expansion leading to radicle protrusion. In soybean embryonic axes, genome analysis identified 2,143 genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and assembly. Key cell wall genes highly expressed at specific germination stages include expansins, UDP-glucose epimerases, glycosyltransferase (GT) family members, and cellulose synthases. Embryonic axes grow through modulation of these genes with no net increment in biomass, indicating that expansion rather than new cell production drives radicle emergence. Cell wall structural analysis revealed defined patterns of cell expansion and increased cellulose content during germination (Sangi et al., 2019).

In the related legume chickpea (*Cicer arietinum*), transcriptional profiling showed that among four alpha-expansin genes, only Ca-EXPA1 was highly expressed in embryonic axes during germination. Alpha-expansins and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) acting on the cellulose/xyloglucan network appear to be the primary drivers of axis elongation, while beta-galactosidases involved in pectin degradation were not expressed during germination (Hernandez-Nistal et al., 2006).

Expansins are extracellular proteins that facilitate cell wall extension by disrupting hydrogen bonding between hemicellulosic wall components (mainly xyloglucans) and cellulose microfibrils, in a pH-dependent manner consistent with acid growth.

## 2. SUGAR SENSING AND MOBILIZATION IN SOYBEAN SEEDS

### 2.1 Invertases in Germination

#### 2.1.1 Invertase Gene Family in Soybean

A systematic genome-wide survey identified 32 putative invertase genes in the soybean genome. These are classified as:
- **Cell wall invertases (CWI):** Insoluble, cell wall-bound enzymes with optimal pH of 3.5-5.0, targeting the apoplast.
- **Vacuolar invertases (VI):** Soluble, vacuole-localized enzymes with optimal pH of 5.0-5.5.
- **Cytoplasmic/alkaline/neutral invertases:** Cytosol-localized with neutral pH optima.

Among these, GmCWI4 was experimentally characterized as a typical extracellular invertase that is responsive to fungal pathogens (Ni et al., 2018).

DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082395 [NOTE: Full author list partially verified; first author confirmed as Ni from PMC6121457]

#### 2.1.2 Invertase Inhibitors and Their Role

Both CWI and VI are subject to post-translational inhibition by small inhibitory proteins. In soybean, two putative invertase inhibitors -- GmCIF1 and GmC/VIF2 -- have been functionally characterized. GmCIF1 specifically inhibits CWI activity during seed maturation. RNAi suppression of GmCIF1 produced marked elevations of CWI activity, improvements in seed weight, and higher accumulations of hexoses, starch, and protein in mature seeds, suggesting that post-translational elevation of CWI by silencing GmCIF1 expression orchestrates seed maturation through fine-tuning sucrose metabolism and sink strength (Tang et al., 2017).

In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function of the orthologous AtCIF1 accelerated seed germination independently of exogenous ABA, coinciding with a drastic increase in CWI activity and boosted hexose levels in germinating seeds by 24 hours after imbibition onset. This provides a model for how invertase inhibitor regulation might function during soybean germination as well.

### 2.2 Sucrose/Glucose Signaling During Germination

Sugar signaling operates through at least three glucose signal transduction pathways in plants: hexokinase (HXK)-dependent pathways, HXK-independent pathways, and glycolysis-dependent pathways. HXK acts as a bifunctional enzyme and the key connecting element between sugar signaling and plant hormone signaling.

In soybean, 17 GmHXK genes have been identified. GmHXK2 was shown to be localized on both vacuolar and cell membranes and plays a role in salt stress tolerance, providing evidence for hexokinase function in soybean development and stress response.

Sugar metabolism studies in germinating soybean seeds revealed a unique sorbitol pathway functioning in soybean axes. Accumulation of sorbitol in the axes starts on day 1 of germination as sucrose decreases and glucose and fructose increase. Fructokinase and glucokinase are present in both axes and cotyledons. The interconversion of glucose and fructose with sorbitol as an intermediate is catalyzed by ketose reductase and aldose reductase, which are detected in germinating axes but not in cotyledons. Sorbitol and hexose accumulation is highly correlated with increased invertase activity in the axes (Kuo et al., 1990).

### 2.3 T6P/SnRK1 Pathway in Legumes

Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) acts as a global regulator of metabolism and transcription, promoting plant growth and triggering developmental phase transitions in response to sugar availability. T6P directly links to the SnRK1 (Sucrose-non-fermenting1-Related Kinase 1) family, which acts as sensors of energy levels. Twenty trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) genes have been identified in the soybean genome. GmTPS12a positively regulates seed germination under salt and osmotic stress by repressing the ABA response, and is mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.

In the model legume *Medicago truncatula*, the trehalose pathway during seed imbibition has been characterized in detail. Nine MtTPS, eight MtTPP, and a single MtTRE gene were identified. Data show a temporal distribution and preferential expression of specific TPS and TPP isoforms during seed imbibition, with a small set of genes (MtTPS1, MtTPS7, MtTPS10, MtTPPA, MtTPPI, MtTRE) potentially serving as early hallmarks of the seed stress response. Trehalose levels decreased significantly during imbibition, suggesting trehalose may serve as an energy source rather than solely as an osmoprotectant. MtSnRK1 is highly expressed in dry seed and its expression decreases during imbibition, consistent with SnRK1's known role in obstructing germination in relation to the ABA signaling pathway (Macovei et al., 2019).

The T6P-SnRK1 interaction is now understood as follows: T6P inhibits SnRK1 activity, thereby allowing growth-promoting processes to proceed when sugar levels are adequate. In seeds, high SnRK1 activity during maturation and dormancy suppresses germination; the decline in SnRK1 activity during imbibition (paralleled by changes in T6P levels) permits the transition from dormancy to germination.

## 3. REDOX BIOLOGY IN SOYBEAN GERMINATION

### 3.1 Glutaredoxin Family in Soybean

The complete repertoire of thioredoxins (Trx) and glutaredoxins (Grx) in soybean has been characterized, with 12 Trx and 12 Grx genes identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed robust correspondence between soybean Grx groupings and the same protein families in other species. Under water restriction conditions, water deficit altered the expression of a greater number of differentially expressed genes than nodulation status, with 12 Trx and 12 Grx differentially expressed genes identified. Importantly, the study found evidence of translational regulation (not just transcriptional) of these genes, as discrepancies between transcript and polysome-associated mRNA levels were detected. An enriched network was identified in which a GmTrx and a GmGrx interacted with each other and associated with nitrogen metabolism enzymes, suggesting integration of redox control with the biological nitrogen fixation process (Sainz et al., 2022).

### 3.2 ROS "Oxidative Window" in Legume Germination

The concept of an "oxidative window" was proposed to describe a critical range in which ROS can play a positive role in seed metabolism without being detrimental. ROS are produced from embryogenesis to germination in both metabolically active cells and quiescent dry tissues. The reactivation of metabolism during seed imbibition causes enhanced ROS accumulation, generally resulting from electron leakage within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. If the balance between ROS production and scavenging is lost, seeds undergo oxidative stress that can induce seed death (Bailly, 2004; El-Maarouf-Bouteau and Bailly, 2008).

In soybean specifically, ROS produced in the embryonic axis after imbibition induce the production of endogenous ethylene, which promotes cell elongation in the root tip -- establishing a direct mechanistic link between redox signaling and germination progression (Ishibashi et al., 2013).

Early work in soybean demonstrated that in low-viability (stressed) seeds, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and Mn-superoxide dismutase activities were significantly increased compared to high-viability seeds, with SOD induction resulting from accumulation of transcripts in response to superoxide production. Catalase induction did not occur in low-viability seeds, resulting in dramatic accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Zeatin riboside (an endogenous cytokinin) was present in large quantities in high-viability seeds but was oxidized to adenine in low-viability seeds. Zeatin riboside, but not adenine, acted as a scavenger of superoxide anions, suggesting an unexpected antioxidant role for cytokinins in seed viability maintenance (Gidrol et al., 1994).

### 3.3 Antioxidant Systems During Imbibition

The activities of enzymes involved in hydroperoxide metabolism -- including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase, and glutathione and ascorbate peroxidases -- markedly change during the germination of soybean embryonic axes. SOD is the enzymatic activity most affected during the initial stages of germination. Early and foundational measurements showed that soybean embryonic axes produced both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, with their metabolism changing dynamically during the imbibition-to-germination transition (Puntarulo et al., 1991). Subsequent work demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide metabolism in soybean embryonic axes at the onset of germination involves catalase as the primary H2O2-utilizing enzyme (Puntarulo et al., 1988).

The ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase [APX], monodehydroascorbate reductase [MDHAR], dehydroascorbate reductase [DHAR], and glutathione reductase [GR]) also undergo significant dynamic changes, working in concert with SOD and CAT to maintain redox homeostasis and protect seed viability during the metabolically vulnerable imbibition period.

## 4. ION HOMEOSTASIS

### 4.1 Cation Transport Regulators in Seeds

Ion homeostasis is fundamental to seed development and germination. Transporters critical for germination include the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter (NHX), potassium transporter family (HAK/KUP/KT), and chloride channel proteins (CLC). Potassium (K+), the most abundant inorganic cation in plants, makes up to 10% of total plant dry weight, with cytosolic K+ concentration maintained between 80 and 200 mM. K+ plays essential roles in turgor regulation, osmotic adjustment, cell elongation, signal transduction, and enzyme activation (Martinez-Ballesta et al., 2020).

High-affinity K+ transporters of the KUP/HAK/KT family (e.g., HAK5, KUP7) uptake potassium in the micromolar range at low external K+ concentrations, while low-affinity K+ channels uptake K+ at higher external concentrations (>0.1 mM). In rice, OsHAK9 was shown to regulate seed germination under salt stress by preventing gibberellin degradation through mediating OsGA2ox7, directly linking K+ transport to hormonal control of germination. Similarly, OsHAK21 promotes seed germination by altering K+/Na+ uptake and modulating ABA and ROS levels under salt stress, providing a paradigm applicable to legumes.

### 4.2 Calcium Signaling in Germination

Transient Ca2+ changes in the cytoplasm are sensed and decoded by an array of calcium sensors, including calmodulins (CaMs), calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs), calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs/CPKs).

**CDPKs in Soybean:** The soybean genome encodes the highest number of CDPK genes among characterized species, with 50 GmCDPK genes phylogenetically grouped into 4 distinct clusters and distributed across 13 sub-clusters. Individual classes harbor highly conserved mRNA splicing sites, and their exon numbers and lengths are consistent with phylogenetic relationships, suggesting at least 13 ancestral CDPK genes existed before the monocot-eudicot split. The most pronounced transcriptional responses were detected after drought and ABA treatments, with more than half of all GmCDPKs being upregulated (Hettenhausen et al., 2016). CDPKs are related to ABA signaling in seed germination regulation; in Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of CPK4 and CPK11 resulted in ABA-insensitive phenotypes in seed germination, providing genetic evidence for CDPK/Ca2+ participation in ABA signal transduction.

**Calmodulin-Like Proteins in Soybean:** A comprehensive analysis identified 41 true GmCMLs with greater than 50% similarity with Arabidopsis CMLs. Of 36 GmCMLs analyzed, 25 were shown to function as calcium-binding proteins having EF-hand motifs. GmCML1, GmCML2, and GmCML15 showed very high similarity with SCAM-4, SCAM-5, and Calmodulin, respectively, which are known to be involved in plant defense against pathogen attack. Interestingly, GmCML5 and GmCML6 were shown to be involved in nodulation of soybean roots, linking calcium signaling to the legume-specific symbiotic process (Yadav et al., 2022).

## 5. DEFENSE-GROWTH TRADEOFF IN SOYBEAN

### 5.1 Metabolic Costs of Defense in Legumes

Immune activation is metabolically costly and is often associated with growth and development penalties. High genetic immunity to disease has frequently been accompanied by undesired reductions in crop growth and yield. In soybean, pathogens and pests are responsible for annual yield losses of up to 21.4% on average. The mechanisms governing growth-defense tradeoffs generally fall under two hypotheses: a "passive" redistribution of metabolic resources, or an "active" regulatory choice to optimize plant fitness (Gao et al., 2024).

Isoflavonoids represent a major metabolic investment specific to legumes. Daidzein is the first committed metabolite in the biosynthetic pathway to glyceollin, the principal soybean phytoalexin. Glycitein-type isoflavonoids function as constitutive phytoanticipins, whereas glyceollins act as inducible phytoalexins. Both daidzein and genistein are present as large pools of preformed glucosyl- and malonyl-glucosyl conjugates in soybean seedling tissues, being released by hydrolysis in response to pathogen challenge.

Metabolic profiling of soybean seed resistance to *Fusarium fujikuroi* showed that metabolites in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism and tryptophan metabolism were induced by the fungus, while different metabolites were enriched in isoflavone biosynthesis and flavone biosynthesis pathways, illustrating the metabolic rerouting that occurs when defense is activated during seed/seedling stages (Chang et al., 2022).

### 5.2 Disease Resistance Gene Regulation in Soybean

A total of 319 putative NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site - leucine-rich repeat) disease resistance genes have been mapped genome-wide in soybean. The number of NBS-LRR genes correlates with the number of disease resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) flanking these genes on each chromosome. These R-proteins utilize at least three structurally distinct classes: TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL; e.g., Rpp3), CC-NBS-LRR (CNL; e.g., Rpp4), and ULP1-NBS-LRR (e.g., Rpp1) (Kang et al., 2012).

The expression patterns of NBS-LRR family genes are context-dependent: they were up-regulated by soybean mosaic virus (SMV) infection in the resistant variety RV8143, while down-regulated in susceptible variety Hefeng25, indicating active regulation of the R-gene repertoire.

A comprehensive review of breeding for disease resistance in soybean provides a global atlas of QTLs, genes, and alleles conferring resistance to 28 important diseases, documenting the scope of genetic defense resources available in soybean germplasm (Lin et al., 2022).

The connection between defense gene expression and germination fitness remains an active area of investigation. Current evidence suggests that higher expression levels of disease resistance genes can retard seed germination and early seedling growth because they may negatively regulate starch metabolism and divert resources from growth processes. However, direct experimental quantification of this tradeoff specifically during soybean germination remains limited.
