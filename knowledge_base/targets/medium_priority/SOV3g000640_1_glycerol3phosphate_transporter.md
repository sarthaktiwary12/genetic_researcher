### **1. FUNCTION: Glycerol-3-phosphate transporter**

**KNOWN FACTS:**
Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a central metabolic intermediate in plants, crucial for both lipid synthesis and redox homeostasis. It is synthesized in the cytosol from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by cytosolic G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH).

G3P transporters (G3PTs) facilitate the movement of G3P across cellular membranes. In plants, the most well-characterized G3PTs are located on the plastid envelope and mitochondria.
