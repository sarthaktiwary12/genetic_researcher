> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV1g018480.1** is annotated as a Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel (CNGC). CNGCs are plasma membrane-localized cation channels that mediate Ca$^{2+}$ influx in response to cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP), playing crucial roles in various physiological processes, including stress responses, development, and immunity (Gao et al., 2016; J. Exp. Bot.).

Here's a detailed analysis based on current literature:
