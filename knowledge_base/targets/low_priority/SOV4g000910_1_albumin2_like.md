### **Analysis of SOV4g000910.1: Albumin-2 like**

**1. FUNCTION**

*   **KNOWN FACTS:** Albumins are a class of water-soluble proteins. In plant seeds, the most common albumins are 2S albumins, which are major seed storage proteins (SSPs). They are synthesized during seed development and accumulate in the embryo and endosperm. Their primary function is to serve as a reservoir of amino acids and nitrogen, which are mobilized and utilized to fuel early seedling growth during germination. The
