## Executive Summary

This report presents the analysis of **20 predicted exRNA targets** in
Zea mays (maize). These transcripts were identified as potential
targets of bacterial extracellular small RNAs (exRNAs) that may improve seed germination
and seedling vigor when seeds are treated with M-9 bacterial EPS solution.
