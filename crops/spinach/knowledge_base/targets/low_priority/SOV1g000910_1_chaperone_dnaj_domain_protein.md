### Analysis of Spinacia oleracea Gene SOV1g000910.1: Chaperone DnaJ domain protein

**Gene ID**: SOV1g000910.1
**Annotation**: Chaperone DnaJ domain protein
**Assigned Pathway**: protein_turnover

**Experimental Context Summary**:
Bacterial EPS solution "M-9" treatment (4-8 hours) on spinach seeds leads to improved germination rate, vigor, and early seedling growth. The proposed mechanism involves bacterial extracellular small RNAs (exRNAs) with antisense complementarity to spinach transcripts, including SOV1g000910.1, leading to its downregulation.

### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function

*   **KNOWN FACTS**:
    *   DnaJ proteins (also known as Hsp40) are a large family of molecular co-chaperones. Their primary function is to assist Hsp70 chaperones in various protein quality control processes.
    *   They typically bind to unfolded or misfolded proteins and deliver them to Hsp70, stimulating Hsp70's ATPase activity, which in turn facilitates protein folding, refolding, assembly, disassembly, and degradation.
    *   DnaJ proteins are involved in maintaining cellular proteostasis (protein homeostasis) under normal and stress conditions.
    *   In plants, DnaJ proteins are diverse, localized in various cellular compartments (cytosol, ER, mitochondria, chloroplasts), and implicated in a wide array of processes including stress tolerance (heat, drought, salinity), development, and immune responses.
