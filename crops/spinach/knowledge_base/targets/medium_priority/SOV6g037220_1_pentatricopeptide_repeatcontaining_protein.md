### 1. FUNCTION

**KNOWN:**
Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins constitute a large and diverse family of RNA-binding proteins predominantly localized in plant mitochondria and plastids. They are characterized by tandem repeats of a 35-amino acid motif. PPR proteins play crucial roles in virtually all aspects of organellar RNA metabolism, including:
*   **RNA editing:** Catalyzing C-to-U conversions in specific RNA transcripts.
*   **RNA splicing:** Facilitating the removal of introns from
