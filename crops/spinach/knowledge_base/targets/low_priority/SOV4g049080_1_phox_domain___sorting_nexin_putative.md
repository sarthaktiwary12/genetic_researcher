### **1. FUNCTION**

*   **KNOWN**: SOV4g049080.1 is annotated as containing a **Phox (PX) domain** and belonging to the **sorting nexin (SNX)** family. The PX domain is a phosphoinositide-binding module that mediates membrane association.
*   **PREDICTED (based on Arabidopsis/model plant homologs)**: Sorting nexins are a diverse family of conserved proteins involved in various aspects of **endosomal trafficking** in eukaryotic cells. In plants, SNXs play crucial roles in:
    *   **Receptor Recycling and Signaling**: Regulating the endocytosis, recycling, and degradation of plasma membrane receptors (e.g., hormone receptors like the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, auxin efflux carriers like PIN proteins, and immune receptors like PRRs). This modulates the strength and duration of signaling pathways.
    *   **Vesicle Formation and Cargo Sorting**: Facilitating the formation of transport vesicles and sorting specific cargo proteins to their correct destinations
