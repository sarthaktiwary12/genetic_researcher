## Executive Summary

This report presents the analysis of **31 predicted exRNA targets** in
Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa). These transcripts were identified as potential
targets of bacterial extracellular small RNAs (exRNAs) that may improve seed germination
and seedling vigor when seeds are treated with M-9 bacterial EPS solution.

## Methodology

1. **Target Identification**: Bacterial exRNA sequences aligned against Chenopodium quinoa transcriptome
2. **Gene Analysis (Stage 1)**: Individual gene function analysis via Gemini 2.5 Flash
3. **Pathway Mapping (Stage 2)**: Pathway-level grouping and interaction analysis via Gemini 2.5 Pro
4. **Literature Dive (Stage 3)**: Homolog research and deep literature review
5. **Theme Extraction (Stage 4)**: Cross-cutting biological theme identification
6. **Synthesis (Stage 5)**: Claude-powered ranking, causal modeling, and validation design
