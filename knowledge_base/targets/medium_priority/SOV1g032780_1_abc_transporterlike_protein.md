### Analysis of SOV1g032780.1: ABC Transporter-like Protein

**Gene ID**: SOV1g032780.1
**Annotation**: ABC transporter-like protein
**Assigned Pathway**: transport_ion_homeostasis

**Experimental Context Summary**:
*   **Organism**: *Spinacia oleracea* (spinach)
*   **Treatment**: Seeds soaked in bacterial EPS solution "M-9" (4-8 hours)
*   **Observed phenotype**: Improved germination rate, vigor, and early seedling growth
*   **Proposed mechanism**: Bacterial extracellular small RNAs (exRNAs) with antisense complementarity to spinach transcripts, leading to downregulation.

#### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function

**KNOWN FACTS**:
*   **ABC Transporters**: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute one of the largest and most diverse superfamilies of membrane proteins across all kingdoms of life. They are primary active transporters, utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis to move a wide variety of substrates across biological membranes against their concentration gradients.
*   **Substrate Diversity**: In plants, ABC transporters are involved in the transport of phytohormones (e.g., abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins (GAs), brassinosteroids (BRs)), lipids, secondary metabolites (e.g., flavonoids, glucosinolates), xenobiotics, heavy metals, peptides, and ions.
*   **Subfamilies**: Plant ABC transporters are classified into subfamilies (ABCA to ABCG) based on
