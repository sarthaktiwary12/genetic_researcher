> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene SOV3g033920.1 encodes a PP2A regulatory subunit A (65 kDa). Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatase, forming a heterotrimeric complex comprising a structural/regulatory A subunit (also known as PP2AA), a catalytic C subunit (PP2AC), and a variable regulatory B subunit (PP2AB). The A subunit acts as a scaffold, mediating interactions between the C and B subunits, and is crucial for the stability and activity of the complex.

Here's a detailed analysis of its homologs and functional relevance:
