# Homolog Research: SOV3g038840.1 - Peroxidase
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Peroxidase
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV3g038840.1** is annotated as a "Peroxidase superfamily protein". Peroxidases (PRXs) constitute a large and diverse family of enzymes in plants, involved in a wide array of physiological processes including cell wall lignification, defense against pathogens, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, and hormone signaling. Given the large number of peroxidase genes in plant genomes, identifying a single "closest" homolog with all functions conserved is challenging, and often, multiple paralogs contribute redundantly to specific processes.
