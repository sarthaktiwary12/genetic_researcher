## Overview

This report identifies conserved and species-specific mechanisms across 6
crop species treated with M-9 bacterial EPS solution containing extracellular small RNAs.

### Crop Comparison

| Crop | Species | Family | Total Targets | High | Medium | Low |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|------|--------|-----|
| Spinach | Spinacia oleracea | Amaranthaceae | 109 | 21 | 49 | 39 |
| Broccoli | Brassica oleracea var. italica | Brassicaceae | 89 | 36 | 18 | 35 |
| Wheat | Triticum aestivum | Poaceae | 75 | 25 | 35 | 15 |
| Quinoa | Chenopodium quinoa | Amaranthaceae | 31 | 4 | 4 | 23 |
| Soybean | Glycine max | Fabaceae | 18 | 7 | 6 | 5 |
| Maize | Zea mays | Poaceae | 20 | 11 | 5 | 4 |


### Plant Family Groupings

- **Amaranthaceae**: Spinach, Quinoa
- **Brassicaceae**: Broccoli
- **Poaceae**: Wheat, Maize
- **Fabaceae**: Soybean


**Key comparisons:**
- **Amaranthaceae** (spinach + quinoa): Same family, highest potential for conserved targets
- **Poaceae** (wheat + maize): Monocot grasses, different exRNA response patterns expected
- **Brassicaceae** (broccoli): Well-characterized via Arabidopsis orthologs
- **Fabaceae** (soybean): Unique nitrogen-fixing symbiosis context

## Conserved Pathways (present in 4+ crops)

- **Cell Wall** — present in 4/6 crops
- **Defense Immunity** — present in 5/6 crops
- **Epigenetic Regulation** — present in 5/6 crops
- **Hormone Signaling** — present in 6/6 crops
- **Metabolic Priming** — present in 5/6 crops
- **Protein Processing** — present in 4/6 crops
- **Ros Redox** — present in 5/6 crops
- **Signaling** — present in 6/6 crops
- **Transport Ion Homeostasis** — present in 5/6 crops


These pathways represent the **core exRNA response** that is likely conserved across
diverse plant families, suggesting fundamental mechanisms of bacterial RNA-mediated
germination improvement.

## Species-Specific Observations

### Monocots vs Dicots
- **Monocots** (wheat, maize): Tend to have more defense_immunity and cell_wall targets
- **Dicots** (spinach, broccoli, quinoa, soybean): More diverse pathway representation

### Within-Family Comparisons
- **Spinach vs Quinoa** (Amaranthaceae): Both show transport/ion homeostasis involvement
- **Wheat vs Maize** (Poaceae): Different target counts but similar pathway patterns

## Cross-Crop Synthesis

_Run cross-crop synthesis campaign to generate detailed analysis._

## Key Findings

1. **Universal defense downshift**: Defense/immunity targets appear across most crops,
   supporting the "defense-to-growth" reallocation hypothesis
2. **Hormone signaling conservation**: Hormone pathway targets present in multiple species
3. **Transport mechanisms**: Ion/nutrient transport targets suggest improved nutrient
   uptake as a conserved exRNA effect
4. **Epigenetic remodeling**: Chromatin/epigenetic targets in several crops point to
   transcriptional reprogramming as a mechanism
