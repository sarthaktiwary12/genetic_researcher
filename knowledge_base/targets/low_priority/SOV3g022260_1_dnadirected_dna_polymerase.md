#### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function

**KNOWN FACTS**:
*   DNA-directed DNA polymerases are a class of enzymes essential for all cellular life. Their primary function is to synthesize DNA from deoxyribonucleotides, using an existing DNA strand as a template.
*   They are crucial for two fundamental processes:
    1.
