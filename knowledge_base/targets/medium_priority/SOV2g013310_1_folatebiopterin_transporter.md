### 1. FUNCTION

**Known/Predicted Function**:
SOV2g013310.1 is annotated as a "Folate-biopterin transporter." This suggests its primary function is to facilitate the movement of folate (vitamin B9) and/or biopterin molecules across cellular membranes.

*   **Folate (Vitamin B9)**: Folates are essential cofactors for one-carbon metabolism in all living organisms. In plants, they are crucial for:
