### 1. FUNCTION: What is the known/predicted function of this gene?

*   **KNOWN (Arabidopsis/Model Plants)**: The *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog, ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 2 (AtEDR2), is a well-characterized **negative regulator of plant immunity**. It encodes a protein containing multiple Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus (MORN) repeats and a coiled-coil domain, which localizes to the plasma membrane. Loss-of-function *edr2* mutants exhibit **enhanced resistance** to a broad spectrum of pathogens, including powdery mildew and bacterial pathogens
