# Homolog Research: SOV4g032870.1 - Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1 (AHP-like)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1 (AHP-like)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene **SOV4g032870.1**, annotated as a Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1 (AHP-like), is a key component of the two-component signaling system, primarily known for its role in cytokinin signal transduction. This family of proteins mediates the transfer of a phosphate group from activated histidine kinases (cytokinin receptors) to response regulators, thereby propagating the signal.

### 1. Arabidopsis Homolog

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog to SOV4g032870.1 is:

*   **Gene Name**: **AHP1** (ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 1)
*   **Locus ID**: **AT3G21510**

**Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related):**

*   **General Cytokinin Signaling**: AHP1, along with other AHPs (AHP2, AHP3, AHP4, AHP5), are positive regulators of cytokinin signaling. Due to functional redundancy, single *ahp1* mutants often display subtle or no obvious phenotypes under normal growth conditions. However, higher-order *ahp* mutants (e.g., *ahp1 ahp2 ahp3 ahp5* quadruple mutants) exhibit severe cytokinin insensitivity, reduced growth, smaller shoot and root meristems, and altered root development, confirming their essential role in cytokinin action (Hutchison et al., 2004, *The Plant Cell*; Nishimura et al., 2004, *The Plant Cell*).
*   **Germination and ABA Sensitivity**: AHPs play a complex role in seed germination, often interacting with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling.
