# Homolog Research: SOV6g036290.1 - Protein HIRA
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Protein HIRA
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV6g036290.1 - Protein HIRA** encodes a homolog of the Histone Regulator A (HIRA) protein, which is a highly conserved histone chaperone involved in replication-independent deposition of histone H3.3 into chromatin. This process is crucial for maintaining chromatin structure, regulating gene expression, and responding to various developmental and environmental cues.

Here's a detailed analysis based on available literature:
