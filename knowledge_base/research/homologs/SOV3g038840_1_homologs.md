# Homolog Research: SOV3g038840.1 - Peroxidase
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Peroxidase
> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene **SOV3g038840.1**, annotated as a Peroxidase, belongs to the large family of Class III plant peroxidases (PRXs). These enzymes are heme-containing glycoproteins found in the apoplast and vacuoles, involved in diverse physiological processes including cell wall formation, lignification, defense against pathogens, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Their role in seed germination is primarily linked to ROS signaling, cell wall modification, and hormone metabolism.
