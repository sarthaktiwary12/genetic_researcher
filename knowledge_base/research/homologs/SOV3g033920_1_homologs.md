# Homolog Research: SOV3g033920.1 - PP2A regulatory subunit A (65 kDa)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for PP2A regulatory subunit A (65 kDa)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene SOV3g033920.1, encoding a PP2A regulatory subunit A (65 kDa), is a core component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, which plays fundamental roles in virtually all aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. Its regulatory A subunit acts as a scaffold, bringing together the catalytic (C) subunit and various regulatory B subunits to form a functional heterotrimeric enzyme.

Here's a detailed analysis based on current literature:

### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

The closest *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog for SOV3g033920.1 (PP2A regulatory subunit A, 65 kDa) is **ROOT CURLING 1 (RCN1)**.

*   **Gene name and locus ID:** **RCN1 (ROOT CURLING 1)**, **AT3G05580**.
    *   Arabidopsis has three PP2A A subunits (RCN1, RCN2, RCN3), but RCN1 is generally the most well-characterized and often the top hit in homology searches for the 65 kDa A subunit.
*   **Known mutant phenotypes (especially germination-related):**
    *   **Root Development:** The eponymous phenotype of *rcn1* loss-of-function mutants is altered root gravitropism, reduced root elongation, and increased root waving (Garbers et al., 1996; Kwak et al., 2002). This highlights its role in auxin signaling and cytoskeletal organization.
    *   **Germination and Early Seedling Growth:** *rcn1* mutants exhibit **hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA)** during seed germination and early seedling development. This means that *rcn1* seeds germinate poorly or have delayed germination in the presence of ABA compared to wild-type seeds (Kwak et al., 2002; Pauli et al., 2016). This phenotype is crucial for understanding its role in germination control.
    *   **Other phenotypes:** *rcn1* mutants also show defects in cell division, cell expansion, and overall plant growth, reflecting the broad importance of PP2A activity (Kwak et al., 2002).
*   **Key publications characterizing this gene:**
    *   **Garbers, C., et al. (1996).** *RCN1, a gene required for root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, encodes a protein homologous to the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A.* **The Plant Cell**, 8(11), 1957-1967. (Initial cloning and characterization, establishing its role in root development).
    *   **Kwak, J. M., et al. (2002).** *The Arabidopsis ROOT CURLING 1 gene regulates root gravitropism and auxin transport.* **The Plant Journal**, 30(2), 173-182. (Further characterization, linking RCN1 to auxin transport and ABA sensitivity).
    *   **Pauli, L., et al. (2016).** *PP2A-B55-RCN1 and PP2A-B'γ complexes are major negative regulators of SnRK2s in Arabidopsis thaliana.* **The Plant Cell**, 28(10), 2529-2543. (Elucidates the molecular mechanism of RCN1 in ABA signaling, showing its role in dephosphorylating SnRK2s).

### 2. OTHER MODEL SPECIES

PP2A regulatory subunit A homologs are highly conserved across plant species.

*   **Rice (*Oryza sativa*):** Rice also possesses multiple PP2A A subunits (e.g., OsPP2AA1, OsPP2AA2). These genes are involved in various developmental processes and stress responses, similar to Arabidopsis.
    *   **Germination/seedling vigor phenotypes:** While specific *OsPP2AA* knockout phenotypes directly linked to germination might not be as widely detailed as in Arabidopsis, PP2A activity is known to be crucial for rice development and stress tolerance. For instance, PP2A complexes in rice are implicated in ABA and GA signaling, which are central to germination and seedling establishment (e.g., through regulation of SnRK2s or DELLA proteins). Studies on drought and salt stress often highlight the role of PP2A in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting seedling survival (e.g., Wang et al., 2011, *Plant Cell Rep* for general PP2A role in stress).
*   **Tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*):** Tomato homologs (e.g., SlPP2AA) are also present and are expected to play similar fundamental roles.
    *   **Germination/seedling vigor phenotypes:** Less specific data on *SlPP2AA* mutants directly impacting germination is readily available in the literature compared to Arabidopsis. However, given the universal importance of PP2A in plant hormone signaling and development, its activity would undoubtedly be critical for tomato seed germination and seedling vigor. PP2A has been implicated in fruit ripening and stress responses in tomato, suggesting its broad regulatory functions (e.g., through interactions with ethylene or auxin pathways).
*   **Other crops:** PP2A A subunits are universally present in plants and are essential. Their roles in development, hormone signaling (ABA, GA, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene), and stress responses are broadly conserved across species, including maize, soybean, and various fruit crops.

### 3. FUNCTIONAL EVIDENCE

*   **Loss-of-function (knockout/knockdown) phenotypes (Arabidopsis *rcn1*):**
    *   **Developmental defects:** Altered root gravitropism, reduced root elongation, increased root waving, reduced plant size, abnormal leaf morphology (Garbers et al., 1996; Kwak et al., 2002).
    *   **Hormone signaling:** Hypersensitivity to ABA during germination and early seedling growth; altered responses to auxin.
    *   **Cellular processes:** Defects in cell division and expansion, likely due to PP2A's role in cell cycle regulation and cytoskeleton dynamics.
*   **Overexpression phenotypes:**
    *   Overexpression of the PP2A A subunit alone is less commonly reported for its specific phenotypic effects, as the functional complex requires all three subunits. However, altering the stoichiometry of PP2A subunits
