## Executive Summary

This report presents the analysis of **75 predicted exRNA targets** in
Triticum aestivum (wheat). These transcripts were identified as potential
targets of bacterial extracellular small RNAs (exRNAs) that may improve seed germination
and seedling vigor when seeds are treated with M-9 bacterial EPS solution.
