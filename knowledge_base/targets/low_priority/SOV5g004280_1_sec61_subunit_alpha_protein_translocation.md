### 1. FUNCTION: Sec61 subunit alpha (protein translocation)

*   **KNOWN FACTS**:
    *   The Sec61 complex is a highly conserved, essential component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon in all eukaryotes.
    *   The alpha subunit (Sec61α) is a major integral membrane protein that forms the central pore of the translocon channel.
    *   Its primary function is to facilitate the co-translational and post-translational import of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen or their integration into the ER membrane.
    *   This process is critical for the synthesis, folding, and trafficking of virtually all secreted proteins, integral membrane proteins of the ER, Golgi, vacuoles, plasma membrane, and proteins destined for secretion into the apoplast.

*   **INFERRED CONCLUSIONS (from model plant homologs like *Arabidopsis*)**:
    *   In plants, Sec61α is indispensable for the biogenesis of a vast array of proteins involved in growth, development, stress responses, and intercellular communication.
    *   This includes enzymes for cell wall synthesis and modification, hormone
