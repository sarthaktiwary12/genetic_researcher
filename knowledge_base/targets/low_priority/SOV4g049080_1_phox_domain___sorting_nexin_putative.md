### 1. FUNCTION: Phox domain / sorting nexin (putative)

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   **Phox (PX) domain**: A phosphoinositide-binding domain found in many proteins involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction. It mediates membrane targeting and protein-protein interactions.
*   **Sorting Nexins (SNXs)**: A diverse family of proteins characterized by the presence of a PX domain. Many SNXs also contain a Bin/Amphiphysin/R
