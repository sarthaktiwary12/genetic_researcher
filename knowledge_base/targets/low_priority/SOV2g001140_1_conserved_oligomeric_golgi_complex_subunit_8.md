### 1. FUNCTION

*   **KNOWN FACT (General Eukaryotes)**: The Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is an evolutionarily conserved, eight-subunit tethering complex (COG1-COG8) located on the cytosolic surface of the Golgi apparatus. Its primary known function is to facilitate retrograde vesicle trafficking within the Golgi stack and between the ER and Golgi. It acts as a molecular bridge, recognizing and tethering vesicles containing specific cargo to their target Golgi cisternae, ensuring proper protein and lipid sorting
