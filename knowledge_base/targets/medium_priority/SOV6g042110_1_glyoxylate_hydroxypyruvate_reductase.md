### 1. FUNCTION: What is the known/predicted function of this gene?

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   **Enzyme Class:** Glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GHR; EC 1.1.1.26/1.1.1.81). This enzyme typically has dual specificity, catalyzing the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of both glyoxylate to glycolate and hydroxypyruvate to glycerate.
*   **Metabolic Pathways:**
