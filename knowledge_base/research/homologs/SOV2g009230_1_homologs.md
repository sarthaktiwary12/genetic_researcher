# Homolog Research: SOV2g009230.1 - Trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV2g009230.1**, annotated as a Trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS), is a crucial enzyme involved in the synthesis of trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P). T6P is a central signaling molecule in plants, regulating carbohydrate metabolism, growth, and development.

Here's a detailed analysis based on current literature:

### 1. Arabidopsis Homolog

The closest and most extensively characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog for a Class I Trehalose-phosphate synthase (which synthesizes T6P) is:

*   **Gene Name**: **TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 (AtTPS1)**
*   **Locus ID**: **AT1G06600**

**Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related):**

*   **Embryo Lethality**: Null mutants of *AtTPS1* (*tps1* knockout lines) are **embryo-lethal**, arresting development at the torpedo stage. This highlights the indispensable role of T6P in early plant development (Gomez et al., 2005, *The Plant Journal*; Satoh-Nagasawa et al., 2006, *Plant Cell Physiology*).
*   **Impaired Germination and Seedling Establishment**: Conditional *tps1* mutants (e.g., weak alleles or inducible systems) that bypass embryo lethality, or plants with reduced *AtTPS1* activity, exhibit **severe defects in seed germination and subsequent seedling establishment**. These include delayed germination, reduced root and shoot growth, and altered sugar metabolism (Schluepmann et al., 2003, *PNAS*; Van Dijck et al., 2002, *Plant Physiology*). This is primarily due to the essential role of T6P in regulating the metabolic switch from seed reserve mobilization to active growth.

**Key Publications Characterizing this Gene:**

*   **Schluepmann et al., 2003, PNAS**: Identified T6P as a key signaling molecule in plants, regulating carbon metabolism and growth, and characterized the *tps1* mutant.
*   **Gomez et al., 2005, The Plant Journal**: Demonstrated the embryo-lethal phenotype of *tps1* null mutants and showed that T6P is crucial for embryogenesis and early seedling development.
*   **Satoh-Nagasawa et al., 2006, Plant Cell Physiology**: Further characterized the developmental defects in *tps1* mutants, emphasizing the role of T6P in meristem activity and overall plant architecture.
*   **Lunn et al., 2006, The Plant Cell**: Showed that T6P acts as a signal that inhibits SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 1 (SnRK1), a central energy sensor, thereby linking T6P to global carbon metabolism regulation.

### 2. Other Model Species

The critical role of TPS1 and T6P signaling is highly conserved across the plant kingdom.

*   **Rice (*Oryza sativa*)**:
    *   The ortholog, **OsTPS1**, is also essential. *ostps1* mutants exhibit **severe defects in germination and early seedling development**, including reduced germination rates, impaired root and shoot growth, and altered sugar metabolism, mirroring the *Arabidopsis* phenotype (Kikuchi et al., 2012, *Plant Cell Physiology*; Paul et al., 2018, *The Plant Journal*). OsTPS1 is also crucial for reproductive development and grain yield.
*   **Tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*)**:
    *   **SlTPS1** has been identified. Overexpression of *SlTPS1* in tomato has been shown to improve fruit set and yield, particularly under stress conditions, suggesting its role in stress tolerance and developmental processes (Müller et al., 2015, *Plant Physiology*). While specific germination-related knockout phenotypes are less frequently reported for tomato, the conserved function implies a similar role.
*   **Maize (*Zea mays*)**:
    *   **ZmTPS1** is vital for kernel development and germination vigor. Knockdown lines show reduced kernel size, impaired starch accumulation, and decreased germination rates, further underscoring the universal importance of TPS1 in crop plants (Nuccio et al., 2015, *Plant Physiology*).

### 3. Functional Evidence (Focus on AtTPS1)

*   **Loss-of-function (knockout/knockdown) phenotypes**: As detailed above, *AtTPS1* null mutants are embryo-lethal, and weak alleles or knockdown lines show severe growth retardation, altered sugar sensing, reduced photosynthesis, and sterility (Schluepmann et al., 2003; Gomez et al., 2005). These phenotypes are primarily due to the absence or reduction of the signaling molecule T6P, which acts as a master regulator of carbon metabolism and growth (Paul et al., 2008, *Trends in Plant Science*; Lunn et al., 2014, *Plant Cell Physiology*).
*   **Overexpression phenotypes**: Overexpression of *AtTPS1* can lead to increased T6P levels, but often results in pleiotropic effects, including altered growth, reduced seed set, and sometimes improved stress tolerance, depending on the expression level and context. High T6P levels can also be detrimental, indicating a need for tight regulation (Wingler et al., 1999, *Plant Physiology*; Schluepmann et al., 2004, *Plant Cell and Environment*).
*   **Expression patterns during germination**: *AtTPS1* is expressed throughout plant development, including during seed imbibition and early germination. T6P levels are low in dry seeds, rapidly increase during imbibition, and then decline as reserves are mobilized. This dynamic regulation of T6P is crucial for the metabolic switch required for successful germination and seedling establishment (Gomez et al., 2005; Lunn et al., 2006).
*   **Protein interaction partners**: While direct protein-protein interactions of AtTPS1 with other proteins within a
