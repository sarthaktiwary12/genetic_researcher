> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like
> Last Updated: 2026-02-18

The spinach gene **SOV1g021960.1**, annotated as "Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like," belongs to the SLC12 family of solute carriers, which includes KCC (Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter) and CCC (Cation-Chloride Cotransporter) proteins. These transporters play crucial roles in maintaining ion homeostasis and osmoregulation.

### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog of SOV1g021960.1 is:

*   **Gene name and locus ID**: **KCC1** (Potassium Chloride Cotransporter 1), locus ID **AT1G30400**.
    *   Phylogenetic analysis and ortholog searches (e.g., via Phytozome) consistently identify AT1G30400 as the primary ortholog for KCC-type cation-chloride cotransporters in Arabidopsis, which aligns with the spinach gene's annotation. Arabidopsis has three KCC genes (KCC1, KCC2, KCC3) and three CCC genes (CCC1, CCC2, CCC3). SOV1g021960.1 is most closely related to the KCC clade.

*   **Known mutant phenotypes (especially germination-related)**:
    *   **Reduced K+ accumulation**: *kcc1* loss-of-function mutants exhibit significantly reduced potassium (K+) accumulation in various tissues (Colcombet et al., 2013; Ge et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018).
    *   **Salt stress sensitivity**: *kcc1* mutants are highly sensitive to salt stress (NaCl), showing impaired root growth, reduced biomass, and altered stomatal movements under high salinity (Colcombet et al., 2013; Ge et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018).
    *   **Altered stomatal movements**: KCC1 is expressed in guard cells and is crucial for stomatal opening and closure, impacting water balance (Xu et al., 2018).
    *   **Reduced seed germination under salt stress**: Critically for your query, *kcc1* mutants show **reduced seed germination when exposed to salt stress** conditions. This indicates a direct role for KCC1 in enabling germination under adverse osmotic conditions (Xu et al., 2018).
    *   **Increased ABA sensitivity**: *kcc1* mutants are more sensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in terms of root growth inhibition, suggesting KCC1 might modulate ABA signaling pathways (Xu et al., 2018).
