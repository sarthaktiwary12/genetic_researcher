SOYBEAN (Glycine max) exRNA SEED TREATMENT TARGET ANNOTATION REPORT
================================================================================
Date: 2026-02-17
Annotation sources: NCBI Protein, SoyBase (Wm82.a2.v1 / Glyma 4.0),
                     Ensembl Plants, TAIR (Arabidopsis homologs)
================================================================================

SECTION 1: DUPLICATE CONSOLIDATION
================================================================================

Original list contained 23 entries with the following duplicates noted:
  - GLYMA_01G215100 (repeated)
  - GLYMA_02G220600 (repeated)
  - GLYMA_09G051100 (repeated)
  - GLYMA_09G063900 (repeated)
  - KRH37200 (repeated)

After deduplication: 18 UNIQUE TARGETS
  - 13 unique GLYMA loci (including resolved KRH mappings)
  - 5 additional KRH accessions that map to GLYMA loci not otherwise in list

Total unique GLYMA gene loci after all KRH-to-GLYMA resolution: 18


SECTION 2: KRH PROTEIN ACCESSION RESOLUTION
================================================================================

All KRH accessions are from the Glycine max Wm82.a4.v1 genome annotation
deposited in GenBank. Several records have been removed from NCBI but the
GLYMA gene locus mapping was preserved in the removal notice.

KRH47986 --> GLYMA_07G060700
  Status: NCBI record REMOVED
  SoyBase annotation: Thylakoid membrane protein (CURT1-like)
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT4G01150 (CURT1A)
  NOTE: Original list described this as "cation transport regulator-like
  protein 2-like". SoyBase annotation says thylakoid/CURT1. The discrepancy
  may reflect different annotation pipeline versions or the original label
  may come from a different source. FLAGGED AS UNCERTAIN.

KRH55503 --> GLYMA_06G259700
  Status: Active (KRH55503.2)
  SoyBase annotation: Disease resistance protein, TIR-NBS-LRR class
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT5G45250
  NOTE: Original list labeled "hypothetical protein" and appended "v4" to
  gene ID. SoyBase clearly annotates as TIR-NBS-LRR disease resistance.

KRH37200 --> GLYMA_09G051100
  Status: Active (KRH37200.1)
  SoyBase annotation: Cellulose synthase A4
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT5G44030
  NOTE: This KRH is a duplicate -- GLYMA_09G051100 already in list.

KRH57561 --> GLYMA_05G068700
  Status: Active (KRH57561.1)
  SoyBase annotation: Plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor
                      superfamily protein
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT5G46940
  NOTE: Consistent with original label "putative invertase inhibitor"

KRH33075 --> GLYMA_10G097500
  Status: NCBI record REMOVED
  SoyBase annotation: Hypothetical protein (uncharacterized)
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT3G57440 (also uncharacterized)

KRH35424 --> GLYMA_10G242300
  Status: Active (KRH35424.1)
  SoyBase annotation: Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase
                      (ERECTA-like)
  Arabidopsis homologs: AT5G07180 (ERL2), AT5G62230 (ERL1)

KRH35861 --> GLYMA_10G268800
  Status: Active (KRH35861.1)
  SoyBase annotation: Hypothetical protein; very short (61-64 aa)
  No clear Arabidopsis homolog or domain assignment.

KRH5227 --> LIKELY GLYMA_06G057500
  Status: TRUNCATED ACCESSION -- likely KRH52271 or KRH52270
  Both KRH52271.1 and KRH52270.2 map to GLYMA_06G057500
  SoyBase annotation: Protein of unknown function (DUF1677)
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT1G72510
  FLAGGED: Original accession appears incomplete (5 digits vs normal 5 digits,
  but could be KRH52270 or KRH52271 -- both match same gene).

KRH25272 --> GLYMA_12G091900
  Status: NCBI record REMOVED
  SoyBase annotation: Hypothetical membrane protein
  Arabidopsis homolog: AT5G22340 (poorly characterized)


SECTION 3: GLYMA_09G19270 FORMAT ISSUE
================================================================================

FLAG: The ID "GLYMA_09G19270" has an incorrect number of digits.

Standard GLYMA format: GLYMA_[Chr]G[6-digit number]
  - GLYMA_09G192700 = 6 digits (VALID format)
  - GLYMA_09G019270 = 6 digits (VALID format)

Resolution: GLYMA_09G192700 is the CORRECT ID.

Evidence:
  1. SoyBase returns a valid gene for Glyma.09G192700 on chromosome 9
     (positions 41,734,808-41,738,603)
  2. SoyBase query for Glyma.09G019270 returned errors / no data
  3. GLYMA_09G192700 encodes a well-characterized ROP GTPase (RHO-related
     protein from plants 9), homologous to AT4G28950
  4. Ensembl Plants confirms GLYMA_09G192700 with 153 orthologues

RECOMMENDED CORRECTION: GLYMA_09G19270 --> GLYMA_09G192700

SECTION 5: PATHWAY CATEGORY SUMMARY
================================================================================

ABA/GA / Hormone signaling (4 targets):
  - GLYMA_01G215100: Phospholipase D beta 1 (phosphatidic acid signaling)
  - GLYMA_09G192700: ROP GTPase (ABA signal transduction)

    invertase activity controlling sugar partitioning in seeds)

ROS/redox (1 target):

Cell wall (2 targets):
  - GLYMA_09G051100: Cellulose synthase A4 (primary cell wall biogenesis)
  - GLYMA_05G068700: Invertase/PME inhibitor (also cell wall remodeling via
    pectin methylesterase inhibition)

  - GLYMA_12G091900: Unknown membrane protein
  - GLYMA_07G060700: Thylakoid membrane / CURT1-like

Ion transport (0 confirmed targets):
  NOTE: KRH47986 was originally labeled "cation transport regulator-like
  protein 2-like" but SoyBase annotation for GLYMA_07G060700 indicates
  CURT1/thylakoid. This discrepancy needs experimental confirmation.


SECTION 6: FLAGS AND CAVEATS
================================================================================

1. GLYMA_09G19270: Truncated gene ID. Corrected to GLYMA_09G192700 based on
   SoyBase validation. GLYMA_09G019270 does not appear to be a valid gene.

2. KRH5227: Truncated protein accession. Likely KRH52271 or KRH52270; both
   map to GLYMA_06G057500. Recommend verifying original source data.

3. KRH47986 annotation conflict: Original list says "cation transport
   regulator-like protein 2-like" but SoyBase/NCBI maps to GLYMA_07G060700
   annotated as a CURT1-like thylakoid membrane protein (AT4G01150 homolog).
   CURT1 proteins are NOT cation transporters. Possible explanations:
   a) Annotation may have been updated between genome versions
   b) The KRH47986 record was removed from NCBI, so the original annotation
      may have differed from the current SoyBase entry
   c) The original label may come from automated BLAST annotation against a
      different database

4. GLYMA_06G259700v4: The "v4" suffix in the original list is an annotation
   version marker (Wm82.a4.v1), not part of the canonical gene ID. The
   correct gene ID is GLYMA_06G259700.

5. Three NCBI protein records have been removed (KRH47986, KRH33075,
   KRH25272), indicating these gene models may have been revised in newer
   genome assemblies.

6. Multiple targets (GLYMA_10G097500, GLYMA_10G268800, GLYMA_06G057500,
   GLYMA_12G091900) remain poorly characterized with no experimentally
   validated function. These would benefit from domain prediction via
   InterProScan or AlphaFold structure analysis.
