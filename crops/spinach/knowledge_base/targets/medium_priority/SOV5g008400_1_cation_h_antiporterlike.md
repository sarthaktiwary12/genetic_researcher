### 1. FUNCTION

**Known/Predicted Function (KNOWN/INFERRED):**
SOV5g008400.1 is annotated as "Cation/H(+) antiporter-like". This suggests it belongs to a large family of membrane proteins that facilitate the exchange of cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+) for protons (H+) across biological membranes. In plants, the two major families are:

*   **Na+/H+ Exchangers (NHX)**: Primarily known for Na+ detoxification by sequestering Na+ into vacuoles or extruding it
