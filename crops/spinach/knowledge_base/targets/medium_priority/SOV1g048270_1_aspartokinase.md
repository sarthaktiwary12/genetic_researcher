### 1. FUNCTION: Aspartokinase (AK)

**KNOWN FACTS:**
Aspartokinase (AK; EC 2.7.2.4) is a key regulatory enzyme in the aspartate family amino acid biosynthesis pathway. This pathway leads to the synthesis of four essential amino acids: lysine (Lys), methionine (Met), threonine (Thr), and isoleucine (Ile). These amino acids are crucial for protein synthesis, as well as being precursors for various secondary metabolites and signaling molecules.

In plants, AK typically exists
