### **1. FUNCTION**

*   **KNOWN:** The gene SOV4g002060.1 is annotated as a "Sacchrp_dh_NADP domain-containing protein". This strongly suggests it is a Saccharopine Dehydrogenase (SDH) or an enzyme with similar activity, utilizing NADP(H) as a cofactor. In plants, SDH is typically part of a bifunctional enzyme, Lysine Ketoglutarate Reductase/Saccharopine Dehydrogenase (
