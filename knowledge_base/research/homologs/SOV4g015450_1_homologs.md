# Homolog Research: SOV4g015450.1 - Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUVR5 (putative)
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUVR5 (putative)
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV4g015450.1**, annotated as a putative Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUVR5, belongs to the SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG (SUVH) family of histone methyltransferases. These proteins are crucial epigenetic regulators in plants, primarily involved in depositing repressive histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) marks, which are associated with gene silencing and heterochromatin formation.

Here's a detailed analysis based on current literature:
