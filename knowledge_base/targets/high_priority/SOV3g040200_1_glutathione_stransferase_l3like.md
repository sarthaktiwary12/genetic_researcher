### 1. FUNCTION: Glutathione S-transferase L3-like (SOV3g040200.1)

**KNOWN FACTS:**
*   **Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)** are a superfamily of ubiquitous enzymes in plants, playing crucial roles in detoxification and various physiological processes. They catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to a wide range of electrophilic substrates, making them more soluble and facilitating their detoxification or sequestration.
*   **Diverse roles of plant GSTs**:
    *   **Detoxification**: Conjugation of xenobiotics (herbicides, pollutants) and endogenous toxic compounds (e.g., products of oxidative stress).
    *   **Redox homeostasis**: By modulating GSH levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio, GSTs indirectly influence the cellular redox state, which is critical for signaling and stress responses.
    *   **Stress response**: Involved in responses to various abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, heavy metals, oxidative stress) and biotic stresses (pathogen attack).
    *   **Hormone metabolism**: Some GSTs are involved in the conjugation and inactivation of auxins, or the catabolism of abscisic acid (ABA) or other phytohormones.
    *   **Secondary metabolism**: Participation in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and lignin.
*   **Lambda class GSTs (GSTL)**: The "L3-like" annotation suggests this gene belongs to the Lambda class of GSTs, which is distinct in plants. GSTLs are often implicated in oxidative stress responses and the detoxification of specific xenobiotics.

**INFERRED CONCLUSIONS:**
*   Based on its annotation, SOV3g040200.1 is predicted to be an enzyme involved in conjugating GSH to specific substrates, thereby influencing cellular detoxification, redox state, and potentially hormone metabolism.

**UNCERTAINTY IN ANNOTATION:**
*   The term "L3-like" indicates homology but does not specify the exact substrate specificity
