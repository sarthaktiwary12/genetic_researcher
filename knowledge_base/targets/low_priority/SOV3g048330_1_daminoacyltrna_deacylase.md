### 1. FUNCTION

*   **KNOWN FACTS**: D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases (DTDs) are highly conserved enzymes found across all domains of life. Their primary known function is to act as a quality control mechanism in protein synthesis. Specifically, DTDs remove D-amino acids that have been incorrectly ligated to tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (which are stereospecific for L-amino acids but can sometimes make
