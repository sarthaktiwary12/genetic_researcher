### 1. FUNCTION: Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase-like)

**Known/Predicted Function:**
Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase, also known as N-glycanase) is an enzyme that cleaves the amide bond between the asparagine residue and the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of N-linked glycans, releasing intact N-glycans from glycoproteins. This process
