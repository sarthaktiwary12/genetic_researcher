### 1. FUNCTION

*   **KNOWN/PREDICTED FUNCTION**:
    *   **General Function (based on *Arabidopsis thaliana* EDR2 homolog)**: *Arabidopsis thaliana* EDR2 (At3g04790) encodes a protein homologous to the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* vacuolar protein sorting 45 (Vps45). Vps45 is a SNARE protein involved in endosomal trafficking, specifically in the fusion
