### **Analysis of SOV6g036290.1 (Protein HIRA)**

**1. FUNCTION: What is the known/predicted function of this gene?**

*   **KNOWN (Arabidopsis/Model Plants)**:
    *   HIRA (Histone Regulator A) is a highly conserved component of the HIRA histone chaperone complex, found across eukaryotes.
    *   The primary known function of the HIRA complex is the replication-independent deposition of the histone variant H3.3 into chromatin.
    *   H3.3 is generally associated with actively transcribed genes
