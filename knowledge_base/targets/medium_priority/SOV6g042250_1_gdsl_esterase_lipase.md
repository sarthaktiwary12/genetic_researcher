### 1. FUNCTION: GDSL esterase/lipase (SOV6g042250.1)

*   **KNOWN FACTS (General GDSL family in plants)**: GDSL esterase/lipases (characterized by a conserved Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu motif in their active site) are a large and functionally diverse family of serine hydrolases found throughout the plant kingdom. They exhibit broad substrate specificity, acting on various esters and lipids. Their known roles include:
    *   **Lipid Metabolism**: Hydrolysis of triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and galactolipids. This is crucial for energy mobilization from storage lipids.
    *   **Cell Wall Modification**: Involvement in modifying components like pectin, suberin, cutin, and waxes, impacting cell expansion, cuticle formation, and barrier functions.
    *   **Defense Responses**: Many GDSLs are induced by pathogen attack and abiotic stresses. They can contribute to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) perception, defense signaling, and the production of antimicrobial compounds or phytoalexins.
    *   **Development**: Roles in various developmental processes, including organ
