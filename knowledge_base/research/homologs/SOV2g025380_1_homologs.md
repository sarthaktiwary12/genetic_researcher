# Homolog Research: SOV2g025380.1 - Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like
> TL;DR: Homolog analysis for Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like
> Last Updated: 2026-02-17

The spinach gene **SOV2g025380.1**, annotated as a "Cation-chloride cotransporter 1-like", belongs to the Cation-Chloride Cotransporter (CCC) family, which plays crucial roles in ion homeostasis, particularly potassium (K$^+$), sodium (Na$^+$), and chloride (Cl$^-$) transport, and in adaptation to abiotic stresses. These transporters are typically localized to the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane) or plasma membrane.

### 1. ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG

The closest characterized *Arabidopsis thaliana* homolog to SOV2g025380.1 is **_CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTER 1_ (CCC1)**.

*   **Gene Name and Locus ID**: **_CCC1_ (AT1G66760)**.
*   **Known Mutant Phenotypes (especially germination-related)**:
    *   **Ion Homeostasis**: _ccc1_ loss-of-function mutants exhibit altered K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ distribution, with reduced accumulation in shoots and increased levels in roots. This is due to impaired vacuolar K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ sequestration (Colmenero-Flores et al., 2007; Henderson et al., 2015).
    *   **Stress Sensitivity**: _ccc1_ mutants are hypersensitive to various abiotic stresses, including high salinity (NaCl), osmotic stress (e.g., mannitol), and drought. They show reduced growth and biomass under these conditions (Colmenero-Flores et al., 2007; Henderson et al., 2015).
    *   **Germination**: Under normal conditions, _ccc1_ mutants do not show a significant germination phenotype. However, under stress conditions (e.g., high NaCl or mannitol), _ccc1_ seeds exhibit significantly reduced germination rates and delayed radicle emergence compared to wild-type, highlighting its role in stress-resilient germination (Colmenero-Flores et al., 2007).
    *   **Stomatal Function**: _ccc1_ mutants show reduced stomatal aperture and impaired K$^+$ uptake by guard cells, contributing to their drought sensitivity (Henderson et al., 2015).
*   **Key Publications Characterizing this Gene**:
    *   **Colmenero-Flores, J. M., et al. (2007).** The Arabidopsis CCC1 gene is a putative H$^+$-K$^+$/Cl$^-$ cotransporter involved in K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ homeostasis and salt tolerance. *The Plant Cell*, 19(11), 3712-3727. (First detailed characterization of AtCCC1).
    *   **Henderson, L., et al. (2015).** Arabidopsis Cation-Chloride Cotransporter 1 (CCC1) is a vacuolar K$^+$/Cl$^-$ cotransporter that is essential for stomatal function and drought tolerance. *Plant Physiology*, 167(4), 1419-1433. (Further insights into vacuolar localization and role in stress).

### 2. OTHER MODEL SPECIES

Homologs of CCCs are widely conserved across plants, playing similar roles in ion homeostasis and stress tolerance.

*   **Rice (_Oryza sativa_)**:
    *   **Homolog**: **_OsCCC1_ (Os03g0126700)** is a well-characterized homolog.
    *   **Phenotypes**: Similar to *Arabidopsis*, _OsCCC1_ is localized to the tonoplast and is crucial for K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ homeostasis. Knockout mutants of _OsCCC1_ show reduced growth, altered K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ distribution, and increased sensitivity to salt stress. Overexpression of _OsCCC1_ enhances salt tolerance in rice (Sonia et al., 2020).
    *   **Germination/Seedling Vigor**: While not specifically focused on germination, the altered ion balance and stress sensitivity in _OsCCC1_ mutants would likely translate to reduced germination rates and seedling vigor under adverse conditions, similar to *Arabidopsis*.
    *   **Reference**: **Sonia, A. R., et al. (2020).** The tonoplast-localized cation-chloride cotransporter OsCCC1 is essential for K$^+$ homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice. *Plant, Cell & Environment*, 43(1), 221-235.

*   **Tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_)**:
    *   **Homolog**: **_SlCCC1_ (Solyc06g050360)** has been identified.
    *   **Phenotypes**: Less extensively characterized than *Arabidopsis* or rice in terms of whole-plant stress responses or germination. Studies suggest a role in K$^+$ and Cl$^-$ transport, potentially influencing fruit development and quality, such as sugar accumulation in fruits (Xu et al., 2016). Direct evidence for germination phenotypes is limited.
