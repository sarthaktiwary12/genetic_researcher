### 1. FUNCTION: GDSL esterase/lipase (SOV4g008190.1)

*   **Known/Predicted Function**: GDSL esterase/lipases (GELPs) constitute a large and diverse family of serine hydrolases found across all kingdoms of life. In plants, they are characterized by a conserved GDSL motif near the N-terminus and are known for their broad substrate specificity, acting as esterases, lipases, acyltransferases, and thioesterases. Their functions are highly varied
