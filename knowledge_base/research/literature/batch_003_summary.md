## Analysis

Here's an assessment of the spinach gene targets for their relevance to germination improvement when downregulated by bacterial exRNAs:

| Gene ID          | Priority | Key reason downregulation helps germination                                    | Evidence strength |
| :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| SOV1g011940.1    | Low      | Unknown function; *if* it inhibits germination.                                | Unknown           |
| SOV1g021670.1    | Medium   | Reduced defense response could reallocate resources or remove growth inhibition. | Moderate          |
| SOV1g048270.1    | Low      | Downregulation of essential amino acid synthesis is highly unlikely to improve. | Weak              |
| SOV2g038560.1    | Low      | Downregulation would likely impair stress tolerance, hindering germination.    | Weak              |
| SOV3g007450.1    | Low      | Unknown specific role; too broad to assess plausibility.                       | Unknown           |
| SOV3g031450.1    | Medium   | Could be involved in stabilizing germination-inhibiting proteins or degrading promoting ones. | Moderate          |
| SOV4g000010.1    | Low      | Essential for protein synthesis; downregulation would severely hinder germination. | Weak              |
| SOV4g008190.1    | Medium   | Could be involved in dormancy-promoting lipid metabolism or hormone signaling. | Moderate          |
| SOV4g015450.1    | High     | Reduced repressive histone methylation (e.g., H3K9me2) could activate germination-promoting genes. | Strong            |
| SOV4g032870.1    | High     | Direct involvement in hormone signaling (e.g., cytokinin, ethylene, ABA crosstalk) where its activity inhibits germination. | Strong            |
