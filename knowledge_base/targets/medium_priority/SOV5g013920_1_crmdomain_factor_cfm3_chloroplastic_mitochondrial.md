#### 1. FUNCTION: Known/Predicted Function of this Gene

**KNOWN:**
*   **CRM-domain proteins** (Chloroplast RNA Splicing and Ribosome Maturation) are a family of RNA-binding proteins found in plants, primarily localized to chloroplasts and mitochondria.
*   They are well-established to play crucial roles in **organellar RNA metabolism**, including:
    *   **RNA splicing**: Facilitating the removal of introns from precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) and transfer RNAs (pre-tRNAs).
    *   **RNA editing**: Modifying specific nucleotides in organellar transcripts.
    *   **RNA stability and processing**: Protecting RNAs from degradation and ensuring their proper maturation.
    *   **Ribosome biogenesis**: Essential for the assembly and function of organellar ribosomes.
*   **CFM3 (CRM-domain Factor 3)** is a specific member of this family. Based on Arabidopsis homologs (e.
